Asteroids,"# Asteroids Instruction Manual

## Introduction
Welcome to Asteroids, the classic arcade space shooter game! Your objective is to pilot your spaceship through an asteroid field, avoiding and destroying the asteroids while avoiding alien ships. Points are earned by shooting asteroids and enemy ships. This manual will guide you through the basic controls, game rules, and scoring system.

## Getting Started
1. **Power On:** Insert the Asteroids cartridge into your Atari console and turn on the power.
2. **Select Game Mode:** Use the Game Select switch to choose between different variations of gameplay.
3. **Start Game:** Press the Game Reset switch to begin your adventure.

## Controls
1. **Joystick:** 

   - **Left/Right:** Rotate your spaceship counterclockwise/clockwise.
   - **Up:** Fire your ship’s thrusters to move in the direction your ship is facing.
   - **Down:** Activate your hyperspace jump.

2. **Buttons:**

   - **Fire Button:** Fire your ship’s laser cannons to destroy asteroids and enemy ships.

## Gameplay
- **Asteroids:** Large, medium, and small asteroids drift through space. Shooting large asteroids splits them into medium ones; shooting medium asteroids splits them into smaller ones, and shooting small asteroids destroys them entirely.
- **Flying Saucer:** Occasionally, enemy saucers will appear on the screen. They can fire at your ship and should be destroyed for extra points.
- **Hyperspace:** When in a tight spot, you can activate hyperspace to randomly relocate your ship. This is risky as you may reappear in another dangerous location.
- **Lives:** You start with a set number of ships, and you lose a ship if it is hit by an asteroid or enemy fire. Extra lives can be earned by reaching certain score thresholds.

## Scoring
- Large Asteroid: 20 Points
- Medium Asteroid: 50 Points
- Small Asteroid: 100 Points
- Large Saucer: 200 Points
- Small Saucer: 1000 Points

## Game Variations
Asteroids offer different game variations to adjust the level of difficulty and the presence of flying saucers. Use the Game Select switch to choose among these variations.

## Tips for Playing
- **Stay in Motion:** Keep moving to make yourself a harder target for enemy fire.
- **Watch the Borders:** Asteroids and ships reappear from the opposite side when they move off-screen.
- **Use Hyperspace Sparingly:** Hyperspace can save you but can also put you in more danger. Use it as a last resort.
- **Focus on Small Asteroids:** Clear small asteroids first; they are faster and more dangerous.

Enjoy your interstellar journey and good luck in achieving the highest score!","Atari(R) Game Program(tm) Instructions

1. COSMIC SPACE PATROL
On a quiet serene evening the Cosmic Space Patrol sets out for the usual night cruise through the boulevards of space. This beat was always the same; calm, no action and no excitement. For some reason this night feels different. Shortly before 0200 hours some form of intergalactic material is sighted through the visual particle counter. The material is too large a mass to measure. It's drifting closer. Lookout, it's a giant asteroid boulder and it's headed straight for the Cosmic Spacecraft. The only chance for survival is to dodge the boulder or destroy it. Destroying it doesn't mean just breaking it up, it means vaporizing it. Small asteroid boulders are equally as fatal as large ones.

Whew, the boulder just missed colliding with the Cosmic Spacecraft, but suddenly the Cosmic Space Patrol find themselves surrounded by thousands of the deadly asteroids. The Cosmic Space Patrol must act quickly to save their spacecraft and spare their lives. The spacecraft is equipped with photon torpedoes, hyperspace, shields, and flip control.

The Cosmic Space Patrol is highly trained to handle this situation. Could you do as good a job as the Cosmic Space Patrol? How would you protect yourself if you were caught in a deadly asteroid belt? This is your big chance to fly throughout the demensions of space and fend against asteroid boulders. The longer you survive, the more space hazards you'll encounter.

2. GAME PLAY

The object of the game is to destroy as many asteroid boulders as possible and keep your ship in space as long as possible. Use your Joystick Controller to maneuver your ship through space and press the red controller(fire) button to shoot photon torpedoes at the asteroid boulders. When an asteroid is hit, it may just break up into smaller boulders, or it may be completely pulverized. In some game variations you'll face additional space hazards such as satellites and UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects); both of which may be firing torpedoes at you.

                 FEATURES
Use your Joystick Controller with this ATARI(C) Game Program(tm) cartridge. Be sure to plug the controller cables firmly into the jacks at the Video Computer System(tm) Game. Hold the controller with the red fire button to your upper left toward the television screen. Use the LEFT CONTROLLER jack for one-player games. See Section 3 of your owner's manual for further details.

Use the Joystick Controller to aim the spaceship and to fire photon torpedoes at the asteroids. Move the Joystick right to rotate the ship clockwise; move it left to rotate the ship counterclockwise. Push the Joystick forward to thrust(propel) the ship through space. (The ship moves only in the direction it's pointed.)

Pulling the Joystick down causes the ship to perform different functions such as hyperspace, shields, or flip(see Section 6, GAME VARIATIONS). After aiming the spaceship with your Joystick, press the fire button to shoot photon torpedoes at the asteroid boulders. Continue to press and release the fire button as fast as possible to quickly destroy all the asteroids.

If the game variation you're playing includes satellites and UFOs, use your Joystick to aim and press the fire button to shoot torpedoes at them just as you would for the asteroid boulders.

4. CONSOLE CONTROLS

GAME SELECT SWITCH

To select an ASTEROIDS(tm) game, press down the game select switch. (See Section 8, GAME SELECT MATRIX to choose the game you wish to play.) The game number and the number of players appear at the top of the screen. The game number is on the left; the number of players is on the right as shown in Figure 1.

GAME RESET SWITCH

Once you have selected a game number, press down the game reset switch to start the action. Each time game reset is pressed down the game starts over. After the game starts, the score appears at the top of the screen as shown in Figure 2.

NOTE: To change game numbers quickly, hold down game select and game reset together.

DIFFICULTY SWITCHES

The ASTEROIDS game has two difficulty levels, a and b. The b level is normal game play for beginning players. The a level offers a bigger challenge with the addition of UFOs(Unidentified Flying Objects) and satellites(see Figures 3 and 4). UFOs are tough to hit, but each one is worth 1000 points. (See Section 5 for SCORING.)

Satellites are larger and easier to destroy. UFOs and satellites may be firing back at you, so be on the lookout for their stray artillery. UFOs do not attack until you have reached over 15,000 points. When satellites and UFOs sneak up to attack you, you'll hear their engines. The satellites have a low pitched engine sound and the UFOs have a higher pitched sound.

TV TYPE SWITCH

Set this switch to color if your television is color or to b/w if your television is black-and-white. Setting this switch to b/w will not affect a color television.

5. SCORING

Points are determined by the size of the asteroid boulders. Obviously, the smaller boulders are harder to hit and therefore worth more points. With each game or turn you have four spaceships. You can earn extra spaceships by scoring high as indicated in the GAME SELECT MATRIX.

Points are scored as follows:
SMALL ASTEROIDS              100 POINTS

MEDIUM ASTEROIDS              50 POINTS

LARGE ASTEROIDS               20 POINTS

SATELLITES 200 POINTS
UFOs 1000 POINTS
6. GAME VARIATIONS

ASTEROIDS includes 66 game variations for 1 or 2 players.

FAST/SLOW

FAST/SLOW (F/S) refers to the speed that the asteroids travel.

LIVES

LIVES is a feature which allows you to earn extra spaceships. Game variations provide you with an extra ship every 5000, 10,000, or 20,000 points, depending on the game number you choose. The tougher game variations don't provide any extra spaceships. (See Section 8, GAME SELECT MATRIX for extra ship lives.) You'll hear a beeping sound when an extra spaceship is earned.

FEATURES

Depending on the game variation you choose, you may be able to save your spaceship from destruction by using one of the game features of ASTEROIDS.

Hyperspace Hyperspace (H) is a feature offered in Games 1 through 8 for one player and Games 34 through 41 for two players. by moving the Joystick down, or towards you, hyperspace makes your spaceship disappear in space and reappear at some other place on the screen. Hyperspace is helpful as a quick getaway when an asteroid or boulder is headed toward your spaceship, but it may also be a hindrance if your spaceship reappears in the path of an oncoming asteroid boulder.

Shields Games 9 through 16 for one player and Games 42 through 49 for two players allow you to protect your spaceship by surrounding it with protective shields (SH). Pull your Joystick back towards you to put up shields, but don't use shields for more than two seconds or your spaceship will blow up.

Flip In game variations featuring flip (FL), you can flip your spaceship around 180 degrees which aims it in the opposite direction. Flip is a fast way to attack asteroids coming from behind. Flip is a feature in Games 17 through 24 for one player and Games 50 through 57 for two players.

Games 25-32 (one-player) and Games 58-65 (two-players) have no optional features (W). This makes these game variations more challenging and you must depend solely on your quick skill and coordination.

YOUNG CHILDREN'S VERSIONS

Games 33 through 66 are easy versions for young children. These games feature slow asteroids, hyperspace, and an extra ship each 5000 points.

7. HELPFUL HINTS

After playing ASTEROIDS several times you'll discover which techniques work best for you. Here are some that the space cadets at ATARI found most helpful.

1. When the screen becomes clear of asteroids (just before a new group of large asteroids appears), try to avoid placing your spaceship close to the right or left edge of the screen. New asteroids almost always begin from these edges.

2. It is often helpful to remain in the center of the screen throughout the game, aiming your spaceship right or left in a circular motion.

3. If you're close to earning an extra ship, and your spaceship is about to crash, you may want to cause your spaceship to collide with a small asteroid, UFO, or satellite. You'll earn points even if you crash, and this may be just enough points to earn that extra ship.

4. Try to hit the faster and smaller asteroid boulders. This will give you more protection and more points.

ATTENTION: ATARI(R) ASTEROIDS(tm) Game Program(tm) cartridge owners:

This ATARI ASTEROIDS cartridge is very similar to the famous ATARI coin-operated ASTEROIDS game, but you may notice some game play differences. You will see that the game playfield on your television is smaller and has borders on all four sides. The dark border on the left side of the screen does not interfere with game play. It is a programming characteristic of all ASTEROIDS cartridges. The size of the border varies on different televisions. You may also notice that as asteroids disappear from the top, bottom, right, or left side of the playfield, they ""wraparound"" and reappear at the opposite edge of the playfield.

If you are playing the ASTEROIDS game in the ""a"" difficulty level, UFOs will sometimes begin to attack after you have reached 7500 points, and they will always attack after you have over 15,000 points.

We wish you lots of luck in defending your spaceship, and hope you have many hours of fun playing the ATARI ASTEROIDS game."

GAME OBJECTIVE

The year is 1999, and the nations of the earth have declared a world-wide peace plan. But there is a problem with the proposed truce. A council of military commanders has unleashed battalions of automated weapons into the countryside. These aerial fighters, flying saucers, tanks, and supertanks will turn the world into a lifeless landscape unless you can stop them.

Luckily, you've discovered an old military tank hidden inside the museum. Use your Joystick to steer the tank as you search for enemy automatons. Since your electronic periscope only gives you a front view from the tank, you'll have to rely heavily on your radar screen to detect the enemy. If you see a blip on the radar, you need to move fast! Use your Joystick to turn your tank until the enemy appears on the screen; press the red controller button to fire your turret gun.

GAME PLAY

You have five tanks to complete your mission. Your tank will be destroyed each time it is hit by enemy fire.

The enemies you'll encounter are:

TANKS
Tanks are your most common enemy. They move a bit slower than your tank, and can be identified by their blue turrets.

SUPERTANKS
These look like regular tanks, but have yellow turrets and can move faster than your tank.

FIGHTERS
Fighters always appear directly in front of you then zigzag toward your tank. When a fighter reaches point-blank range, it will veer to the side and fire an anti-tank shell directly at you. You can identify a fighter by the ""buzz"" sound it makes as it flies.

FLYING SAUCERS Flying saucers do not fire at you, but are hard to hit and can distract you when a tank, a fighter, or a supertank is firing at you.

(Note: Colors may vary with different television sets.)

USING YOUR RADAR SCREEN

Your radar is located at the top center of the screen. Enemy automatons appear on the screen as white ""blips"" of light, your tank is located in the middle of the radar circle. The two lines at the top of the radar screen indicate your field of view. When you move your tank so an enemy ""blip"" is between the lines, you should be able to see the enemy on the main screen. Be careful, though! An enemy can shoot and destroy your tank -- even if you can't see it on the main screen.

A black sighting mark is located at the top of the main screen to help you aim at the target. When the enemy is directly in your line of fire, the sighting mark will change from black to white.

SCORING

TARGET          POINTS
Tank            1,000
Fighter         2,000
Supertank       3,000
Saucer          5,000
Bonus Tank      At 50,000 and 100,000 points
USING THE CONTROLLER

Use your Joystick to maneuver your tank. Plug the Joystick firmly into the LEFT controller jack at the back of your console. Hold the controller with the red button to your upper left, toward the television screen.

Push forward on your Joystick to move your tank forward; pull back on the Joystick to move your tank backward. To rotate your tank in position, push the Joystick directly right or left. Move the tank in an arc by pushing your Joystick diagnally in the desired direction.

Fire your turret gun by pressing the red button on your controller. If you miss a target, you cannot fire again for approximately 2 seconds.

CONSOLE CONTROLS

GAME SELECT/GAME LEVELS

Press the GAME SELECT switch to choose one of three game levels. The game level is indicated by the number of tanks displayed at the bottom of the screen.

GAME NUMBER     SKILL LEVEL
Game 1          Novice
Game 2          Intermediate
Game 3          Advanced
DIFFICULTY SWITCHES/TV TYPE SWITCH

The DIFFICULTY switches and TV TYPE switch have no function in the game.

GAME RESET

Press GAME RESET or the red button on your controller to start the game.

STRATEGY

A good way to evade enemy shells is to rotate your tank 45 degrees, then immediately move the tank forward or backward.
Listen for the sound of an enemy gun being fired. As soon as you hear a shot, take evasive action. Do not simply rotate in the same spot.
Keep moving after you fire a shot -- don't want to see if the shot hit its mark.
If a tank is close behind, you can bring it within sight by moving your tank in reverse until the enemy tank appears on the screen. You'll be able to shoot as the enemy tank turns to face you.
Try to lure one enemy into another enemy's line of fire. For example, by moving your tank to one side, you can move a flying saucer into a shot fired by an enemy tank.
Don't waste shots, since you can't shoot your turret gun again until the shell either hits an enemy, or disappears from your main screen."
Berzerk,"# Berzerk Game Manual

## INTRODUCTION
Welcome to Berzerk, the fast-paced action arcade game that challenges your reflexes and strategy in a never-ending battle against legions of hostile robots! Navigate your way through the electrified mazes of a futuristic world as you attempt to outmaneuver and destroy your electronic foes. Your goal: survive and score as many points as possible.

## GAMEPLAY
### Objective
The main objective of Berzerk is to score points by destroying robots and navigating through endless mazes while avoiding lethal obstacles and the Evil Otto, an indestructible enemy that relentlessly pursues you.

### Controls
- **Joystick**: Use the joystick to move your character in any of the eight cardinal and diagonal directions (up, down, left, right, and corners).
- **Button**: Press the red button to fire your laser weapon in the direction your character is currently facing.

### Scoring
- Destroying a robot: 50 points
- Successfully navigating through a room and advancing to the next one: 10 points
- Avoid getting killed by robots, walls, or the Evil Otto to continue accumulating points.

## HAZARDS
### Robots
The main enemies you will face are various robots that shoot lasers at you. Each robot can be destroyed by hitting them with your laser.

### Electrified Walls
The maze walls are electrified. Coming into contact with them results in an instant loss of life.

### Evil Otto
Evil Otto is an indestructible, bouncing enemy that appears to make sure you cannot linger in any room. Otto enters the room after a short delay and cannot be destroyed, only avoided. He moves faster as the game progresses.

## STRATEGIES
1. **Stay on the Move**: Constantly move to avoid becoming an easy target for robots or getting trapped by Evil Otto.
2. **Use Corners Wisely**: Take advantage of corners and obstacles to shield yourself from enemy fire while you plan your next move.
3. **Aggressive Play**: While it’s essential to avoid threats, taking out robots efficiently will score you more points and reduce immediate threats.
4. **Timing**: Leave the current room before Evil Otto appears or when he’s about to catch you; always keep an eye on your escape routes.

## GAME MODES
1. **Single Player**: Navigate the mazes solo and attempt to achieve the highest score possible.
2. **Two Player Alternating**: Players take turns after each life loss, competing for higher scores.

## GAME LEVELS
The game increases in difficulty over time. The robots become more numerous and aggressive, and Evil Otto becomes faster. Mastery involves not just quick reflexes but also strategic planning and timing.

## LIVES
- You start with a set number of lives (usually 3).
- Losing all your lives will end the game.
- Extra lives may be awarded at certain score thresholds in specific game settings.

## ENDING THE GAME
The game continues as long as you have lives left. Once all lives are lost, the game is over, and your score is final. Aim to set a high score that challenges others and yourself for future play sessions.

Good luck and have fun playing Berzerk!","BERSERK*

ATARI GAME PROGRAM INSTRUCTIONS
1. GOING BONKERS WITH BERZERK

The Astro Date is 3200 and you are the last survivor of a small group of earth people who came to explore the planet Mazeon. Soon after landing, you discovered the planet is a dark, apparently uninhabitable place. But by then it was too late to turn back because your space craft had been destroyed by Automazeons.

Now you are a prisoner here. You are trapped in a maze where even the walls are death to touch. Grim robot thugs known as ""Automazeons"" stalk you relentlessly and you must systematically pulverize them with your laser gun before they eliminate you with theirs.

You are never safe on the planet Mazeon. Even when you've destroyed the mechanical heavies, Evil Otto, the mad and merciless mind behind the robot gangs, leaps out from where he's been observing the battle. You flee in panic because you know that you cannot kill Evil Otto and that, once he catches you, you'll never escape.

He will pound you to a lifeless pulp, grinning like a maniac all the while. Your only hope is to get out of the electrified maze before Evil Otto catches you.

If you do get out, you find yourself in another maze. Again the faceless robots shoot at you, again Evil Otto pursues you, again you must dodge and shoot and run ... into yet another maze. It's enough to drive you bonkers!

2. GAME PLAY

NOTE: BERZERK is for one player only.

Your challenge in BERZERK is to score as many points as possible without being destroyed yourself. In some game variations, you must elude the robots' expert aims and escape Evil Otto. (See Section 5 for a description of GAME VARIATIONS.)

Use your Joystick Controller to maneuver your man through the maze (but don't touch the walls or a robot, you'll electrocute him!). Press the red controller (fire) button to shoot your laser gun at the robots. You score points for every robot that is destroyed. You score bonus points when all robots in a maze are destroyed - whether they are struck by your laser, pummelled by Evil Otto, hit by other robot lasers, they collide with each other, or run into the electrified wall. Each maze ends when your man perishes or escapes. Figure 1 shows an example of what you may meet in a typical BERZERK maze.

In games where the robots shoot they never start firing until the second maze. This gives you a chance to become familiar with the game. Initially, robots move and shoot slower than your man. But with each consecutive maze, up to the 16th maze, the robots' movements and firing speeds gradually increase. At maze 16, the robots reset to move slowly again (gradually increasing speed with each maze) but their firing speeds remain equal to your man's until the game ends.

You begin the game with three lives. Lives that remain will flash briefly at the bottom of the screen, off-centered to the right, just before a new maze appears. Figure 2 shows you what remaining lives look like. You will lose a life if you: 1) are hit by a robot's laser, 2) run into the electrified wall of the maze, 3) get caught by Evil Otto. In certain game variations, you can earn extra lives. Again, check Section 5 - GAME VARIATIONS, to learn about these variations. When all your lives are lost the game is over.

5. GAME VARIATIONS

BERZERK includes 12 exciting game variations. Before describing each of these games, we would like to acquaint you with game play terminology.

BONUS LIFE
In addition to the three lives you start the game with, extra lives can be won in certain game variations. For example, in Game 1 you receive one new life every time you score 1,000 points. The computer congratulates you with a little tune each time you win another life. A maximum of six lives can be displayed on the screen at one time, although you may have more lives in reserve. The number of lives you can win in these game variations is 255. After that the counter resets to zero and you must start winning bonus lives all over again.

INVINCIBLE EVIL OTTO
When Evil Otto is invincible, he keeps coming at you. There is no deterring him. You can only escape him by running out of the maze.

REBOUND EVIL OTTO
Some games feature a reboud Evil Otto, in which you can actually shoot the grinning head with your laser and he will disappear for a few seconds. Beware! Evil Otto will soon reappear to continue in pursuit of you. Zap him again and he will disappear again. You can make him rebound an infinite number of times.

NON-SHOOTING ROBOTS
In some game variations, the robots aren't armed. You can stand right in front of them but they can't shoot you. Take care, you will still lose a life if you touch one.

GAME 1
In Game 1 you receive an extra life every 1,000 points, there is no Evil Otto to pursue you, but watch out for the robots - they'll be shooting at you!

GAME 2
Game 2 offers a bonus life every time you make 1,000 points, the robots fire at you and Evil Otto rebounds when you shoot him.

GAME 3
You win a new life every 1,000 points in Game 3. You'll need all the lives you can get because in this game Evil Otto is invincible and the robots stalk you with their lasers.

GAME 4
In Game 4 you have the opportunity to gain a new life every 2,000 points, there is no Evil Otto, but the robots are militant and you must dodge their deadly laser beams.

GAME 5
With a rebound Evil Otto and mean robots on the prowl, Game 5 is like Game 2 - except a bonus life is won at 2,000 points rather than 1,000.

GAME 6
Win another life every 2,000 points in Game 6. But watch out for invicible Evil Otto and combatant robot goons.

GAME 7
In Game 7 there are no bonus lives and no Evil Otto. You have only the laser-firing robots to contend with.

GAME 8
Game 8 offers a rebound Evil Otto. Otherwise it is exactly like Game 7.

GAME 9
For a real BERZERK challenge, try Game 9! Here, Evil Otto is invincible, the robot gangs are armed and dangerous, and you have no bonus lives to prolong game play.

GAME 10
In Game 10 you have the opportunity to win a new life every 1,000 points, the robots don't shoot, but watch out for Evil Otto - he's invincible!

GAME 11
You can really rack up the points in Game 11. The robots don't shoot, Evil Otto rebounds and you get a new life every 1,000 points.

GAME 12/CHILDREN'S VERSION
This is the easiest of all BERSERK variations. In Game 12 there is no Evil Otto, the robots don't shoot at you, and you win a bonus life every 1,000 points. It's a good game for beginners or young children.

6. SCORING

Your score is determined by the number of robots that are destroyed. Whether you shoot a robot or it is eliminated by other means, you receive points for every pulverized robot. You will earn bonus points when all the robots in a single maze are annihilated. Occasionally you will meet a super strong robot who is merely stunned by your first shot. Be brave, it will take a second hit to destroy this tough enemy.

Once you begin to score points, your score will appear at the bottom of the screen, off-centered to the right, as shown in Figure 5. When all robots in a maze are destroyed, your score disappears and your bonus points flash on the screen, off-centered on the left, as shown in Figure 6. The computer automatically combines all points and your total score is displayed in the next maze. You can score a maximum of 999,999 points before the score rolls back to zero.

Remember, in game variations where the robots shoot back, they never commence firing until the second maze. This will enable you to learn the maze. But, beginning with the second maze, you will no doubt find it more challenging to survive and continue scoring high points. Points are scored as follows:

7. STRATEGY AND HELPFUL HINTS

When you first start playing the tougher BERZERK variations (games in which the robots shoot and Evil Otto is invincible), you may feel there's no way to survive. Don't despair! The following are some strategies you can use to stay alive longer, score more points, and even escape the dread Evil Otto.

Since the robots' shots cannot penetrate the maze walls, use this to your advantage. Hide behind walls to dodge laser fire, then leap out when it is safe to aim and shoot at robots.
Position robot(s) between your man and Evil Otto. This strategy should cause Evil Otto to destroy the robot(s) first (thereby scoring points for you) and you will have more time to escape.
Evil Otto moves more slowly when there are robots on the screen. But once all the robots are gone, the evil fellow bounds toward you with amazing speed! Remember this so you can position your man near an exit as you finish off the robots, then make a swift escape.
Keep your finger on the fire button as you move from one maze to another. It takes the robots a few seconds to start their attack and you can often blindly zap them when you enter shooting.
Since robots are programmed to follow you, you can influence them by your movement, causing them to shoot at and collide with each other or run into walls.
Evil Otto always enters where the man enters. Try to get away from this danger zone and near an exit as soon as it is safe.
Keep your distance from robot gangs because you can cover yourself in only one direction at a time. When you find yourself surrounded by a gang, shoot your way out and put some space between you and them. It's much easier to see and avoid distant robot fire than close range fire.
When robots shoot on the vertical it is from the left side. You can position your man above or below them on the right side where they can't hit you, but you can blast them.
Unlike you robots cannot shoot on the diagonal. If you stand diagonally to one you will be out of its line of fire while it will be vilnerable to your laser shot (See Figure 3.)
There is a special horizontal laser beam wraparound feature that will help you destroy robots. In mazes that have a right and left exit, you can stand just inside the right exit and shoot through it. Your laser beams will then ""wrap around"" the screen (as shown in Figure 7) and reenter on the left side through that opening. Any robots standing in your line of fire will be struck.

## Game Manual

### Introduction
Bowling for the Atari 2600 simulates the popular sport of ten-pin bowling. The objective of the game is to knock down as many pins as possible using a bowling ball. Players take turns in rolling the ball down the lane, attempting to achieve strikes and spares to maximize their score.

### Game Controls
- **Joystick**: Use the joystick to control the direction and release of the bowling ball.
  - **Left/Right**: Move the bowler left or right on the screen to align the shot.
  - **Button**: Press the button to release the ball.

### Game Play
- **Player Setup**: The game can be played by 1 or 2 players.
- **Player Turn**: Each player takes turns rolling the ball. Aim for the pins and press the button to release the ball.
- **Frames**: The game consists of 10 frames. Each player has two opportunities per frame to knock down the pins, unless a strike is achieved.
- **Scoring**:
  - **Strike**: Knocking down all 10 pins on the first try earns a strike, giving 10 points plus the points from the next two rolls.
  - **Spare**: Knocking down all 10 pins in two tries earns a spare, giving 10 points plus the points from the next roll.
  - **Open Frame**: If neither a strike nor spare is achieved, the points for the frame are the total number of pins knocked down.

### Game Variations
1. **Standard Game**: Players compete in traditional ten-pin bowling.
2. **Challenge Game**: Players face increasingly difficult pin setups.
3. **Solo Practice**: A single player rolls without competition to improve their skills.

### Scoring Notes
- The maximum possible score in a game is 300, achieved by rolling 12 strikes in a row.
- Scores are displayed on the screen, with each player's current frame and total score visible at all times.

### Tips
- **Alignment**: Proper alignment can greatly increase the chances of a strike.
- **Timing**: Mastering the timing for releasing the ball will improve accuracy.
- **Practice**: The solo practice mode is great for honing skills without the pressure of competition.

### Conclusion
Bowling for the Atari 2600 offers a fun and engaging simulation of classic ten-pin bowling. Whether playing alone or with friends, it provides a challenging and rewarding experience suitable for all ages.

Enjoy your game of Bowling and aim for that perfect score!","BOWLING
Use your Joystick Controllers with this ATARI Game Program. TM Be sure the Controllers are firmly plugged into the LEFT and RIGHT CONTROLLER jacks at the rear of your ATARI Video Com- puter System. TM Hold the Controller with the red button to your upper left toward the television screen.
Use a Joystick plugged into the LEFT CONTROLLER jack for one player games.
Note: Always turn the console power switch OFF when in- serting or removing an ATARI Game Program. This will pro- tect the electronic components and prolong the life of your ATARI Video Computer System.
HOW TO PLAY
Your objective is to roll as high a score as possible, whether you're playing a one-player or a two-player game. There are ten ""pins""to knock down. You have two tries (or rolls)to knock down the pins each time you're up. Each game consists of ten""frames""(or turns).
If you succeed in knocking down all the pins on your first roll, it's called a ""strike"". A strike is marked with an ""x""on the TV screen.
If you leave pins standing, but""pick them up""on your second try, it's called a ""spare"". Spares are marked with a """"on the screen.
An""open frame"" occurs when you fail to knock down all ten pins in two rolls. Open frames are in- dicated with a straight horizontal line(-)on the screen.



The ultimate goal in BOWLING is to roll 12 consecutive strikes for a ""perfect""score of 300. See the SCORING sec- tion for a more detailed breakdown of point scoring.
CONSOLE CONTROLS To start the action:
Press the game select switch to choose the game you wish to play. The number of each game appears in the upper left corner of the screen. A 1 or a 2 is displayed in the upper right corner of the screen to indicate whether the game is for one or two players. Press the game reset switch to begin play.
During game play the number of each frame is displayed in the upper left corner of the screen for one-player and two- player games. In two-player games the number of the player who is currently up is shown in the upper right cor- ner of the screen. (Player number 1 is blue; Player number 2 is green.)
CONTROLLER ACTION
Move your Joystick forward (away from you), and back (toward you), to position the Bowler. Press the red button on your Joystick Controller to release the ball.
FORWARD NEUTRAL
BACK 

GAMES 5 and 6 are straight ball games. In these games the direction of the ball cannot be altered after it is re- leased. Positioning the Bowler is the most important move. GAMES 1, 3, and 5 are one-player games. GAMES 2, 4, and 6 are two-player games.
SCORING
STRIKE
SPARE
OPEN FRAME
You have the possibility of scoring from 0 to 30 points in each frame. However, the difference in your score depends on whether you strike, spare, or leave an open frame.
For instance, in an open frame the number of pins you pick up(for both rolls) is simply added to your running score. However, when you pick up all the pins on the second roll for a spare, your running score is not totalled immediately. Instead, the score for that frame remains empty until your 

next roll. At that time, 10 is added to the number of pins you pick up. This subtotal is then added to your total run- ning score.
Whenever you roll a strike your running score is not totalled until after the next TWO rolls. Ten points are then added to the total number of pins you pick up for those rolls.
Therefore, if you roll three consecutive strikes, you score 30 points for the frame in which the first strike occured.
In two-player games, the score for the left player is dis- played at the top left corner of the screen; the right player's score is shown on the right.
In one-player games the score is on the left.
The following is an example of how a game might be scored.
20
40
60
80 100
117
126
135 155
185 

Tenth Frame Bonus
If you spare in the tenth frame, you are allowed one more roll. The number of pins you pick up, plus 10 (because of the spare), is then added to your total score.
If you strike in the tenth frame, the pins you pick up for the next Two rolls are added to your total score.
HANDICAP
(Difficulty Switch)
When the difficulty switch is in the a position the com- puter makes it more difficult for you to roll strikes and spares. (Use the left difficulty switch for one player games.) For the beginning player, it is easier to obtain high scores when the difficulty switch is in the b position.

Special Features of Boxing by Activision

Scoring Points: When you get near enough to your opponent to throw a punch, press the red button. Each punch moves your opponent slightly back and away from the punch. If you move him to the ropes, he can't easily duck the next punch, and you can set up a real scoring barrage. But don't get caughton the ropes yourself!

Watch your distance. If you move in too close, the computer gets tougher; but if you're too far away, you can't land scoring punches.

Give yourself a fighting chance. Put your difficulty setting (the left one) down to b and set the computer's difficulty control (the right one) up to a. Then, when you're ready for a really tough bout, tkae the computer on at b and see how well you do.

HOW TO BE A CHAMPION AT BOXING
BY ACTIVISION
Tips from Bob Whitehead, designer of Boxing

Bob Whitehead, a senior member of Activsion's design team, began designing games for the Atari system in 1977 and worked on numerous well-known game titles. He is busily at work on new games for Activision.

""I wanted Boxing to be fun to play the first time you try it, but I designed some little tricks into the game that will make it more challenging the more you play.

""You'll find that the way to win at Boxing it to hit and dance, hit and dance (just like the pros). Draw off your opponent's jabs by making him punch while you're dancing quickly out of his reach. And watch out! When he gets behind, he gets better. But hang in there is you get behind; after the first minute (of each two-minute bout), the computer gets a little tired, and his reactions slow down. Come on strong at the end of the round and you might still catch him. By the way, I shortened the rounds to 2 minutes because... well, you'll see why when you've gone a couple rounds.

""Your best strategy for winning is to jab your opponent until you move him to the ropes, then charge in, mit it up in close, and keep your red button pressed down. You may be able to repeat a punching combination that builds up your point score fast.

""But--please--be fair to newcomers. Give yourself a handicap when you're showing them Boxing. We don't want you to lose your friends.

Use your Standard Paddle Controllers with this ATARI Game Program.  Be
sure the Controller cable is firmly plugged into the jack at the rear
of your ATARI Video Computer System.  Note that another set of Paddle
Controllers will be necessary for three or four-player games.

Note:  Always turn the console power switch OFF when inserting or
removing an ATARI Game Program.  This will protect the electronic
components and prolong the life of your ATARI Video Computer System.


HOW TO PLAY BREAKOUT

SMASH!  POW!  CRUNCH!  A brick wall appears at the top of the screen, and
your missions is to smash two walls off the playfield -- one brick at
a time.

Use the controller to move the paddle across the bottom of the screen.
With the paddle, hit the ball into the wall.  Each time the ball hits a
brick, the brick disappears and you score points.

A player or team receives five balls per game.  When you miss a ball
with your paddle, the ball disappears from the screen.  Press the red
controller button to serve another ball until all five balls are
played.

When a team or player destroys the first brick wall, a second brick
wall automatically appears on the screen.  Continue to hit the bricks
of this wall and score more points.  The player or team who can destroy
two walls scores the maximum 864 points and wins the game.  NOTE:  If
both opponents destroy the two walls, the team who used the least
number of balls wins.

At the end of two-team games, the playfield of both teams or players
will flash on and off the screen.  That way, players can compare
scores.  Begin a new game and create a new brick wall by pressing the
console Reset button.


TO START PLAY

Each Breakout Game is identified by a number at the top of the
playfield. (See Breakout Game Descriptions for the game numbers.) One
to four players can play each game version.  To prepare for the game
play:
o    Select the number of the game you want to play by pressing the
     console's Game Select switch until the game number appears at the
     top center of the playfield.
o    Press the console's Game Select switch to program the game for
     the number of players.  For example, when the number 3 appears in
     the upper right playfield corner, the game is set for a three-
     player game.
o    Press the Game Reset button to start the game action.
o    Press the red controller button to serve the ball and start game
     action.

One-Player Games:
Using the right controller, one players attempts to destroy the two
walls using five balls.  Or, a player can win by scoring the maximum
number of points, 864.

Two-Player Games:
Two players take turns hitting the wall.  Each player receives five
balls and a brick wall that appears during a player's turn.  One player
continues to hit a ball into the wall until he misses the ball.  Upon a
miss, the opponent's wall appears on the screen.  The opponent then
takes his turn hitting the ball into the wall.  The first player to
destroy two walls OR score the most points after playing five balls
wins the game.

Three-Player Game:
Two players act as a team and play against a one-player team.  Just as
in two-player games, the two teams take turns hitting the ball into
the wall.  Each team receives five balls and a separate brick wall.
When one team misses the ball, the opposing team's wall appears and
play begins.  The first team to destroy a wall OR score the most points
after playing five balls wins the game.

Four-Player Games:
With two players on each team these games are played just like two and
three-player games.  The first team to destroy a wall OR score the most
points after playing five balls wins the game.

When a team or player destroys the brick wall, a new brick wall
automatically appears on the screen.  If any bricks still remain on the
screen after five balls are played, begin a new game and create a new
brick wall by pressing the Reset button.

NOTE:  In games with two-players on each team, each player controls a
paddle which moves across only half the playfield.

Timed Games:
Some games rely on speed scores instead of point scores to win.  A
timer will replace the scoreboard in the upper left corner.  Your
objective is to destroy the wall in as little time as possible.  The
timer counts the seconds, as you try to break your own record in
one-player games.  In two, three and four-player games, your mission is
to destroy the wall with five balls in less time than your opponent.

Invisible Games;
It's the same Breakout action, except this time it's in the dark!  The
wall is invisible until you hit a brick with the ball.  When this
happens, you score points and the entire wall lights up.


BREAKOUT GLOSSARY

Brick Wall:
There are six rows of bricks.  The color of a brick determines the
points you score when you hit it with your ball.
Red - 7 points         Orange - 7 points        Yellow - 4 points
Green - 4 points       Aqua - 1 point           Blue - 1 point

Paddle:
Each player uses a standard Paddle Controller to move the paddle
horizontally across the bottom of the play field.  With the paddle, a
player hits the ball into the wall.

Scoreboard/Timer:
Depending on what game you play, a Scoreboard or Timer will appear in
the left corner.
o    Scoreboard - Some games determine winners using only point
     scores.  During these games, each player's score appears in this
     position.  Scores are determined by the bricks hit during a game.
o    Timer - Instead of determining the winner with the point value of
     bricks, some games feature a Timer in the upper left corner.
     Your mission during these games is to destroy the walls in as
     little time as possible.  The Timer tracks the cumulative minutes
     and seconds of each turn.

Number of Players/Team Numbers:
In this playfield position two numbers will appear at different times
during the game.

o    Number of Players:  After you select the game you want to play,
     you must indicate the number of players.  Press the console's
     Game Select switch until the number of players appears.  For
     example, when number 3 appears, the computer is set for a three-
     player game.
o    Team Number:  The team that is currently hitting the ball is
     designated by a Team Number.  In one-player games the number 1
     will always appear in this position.  In two-player games, each
     player is designated by the numbers 1 or 2.  In three or four-
     player games, the teams are referred to teams 1 or 2.  When
     your TEAM NUMBER appears, it's your turn to score.

Balls/Game Numbers:
In this playfield position two numbers will appear at different times
during the game.

o    Game Number:
     Before you begin play, select the game you want to play with the
     console's Game Select switch.  The number that appears refers to
     the game you will play.  (See the following Game Descriptions for
     game numbers.)
o    Balls:
     After you press the console's Reset button, play action can
     begin.  The number 5 appears in this playfield position and
     refers to the five balls you or your team can serve.  Throughout
     the game, the number will reflect the number of balls that
     remain.


SCORING

In some games, a player scores points by hitting one of the wall's
bricks.  The bricks are worth points.  The number of points is
determined by the brick's color:
Red - 7 points         Orange - 7 points        Yellow - 4 points
Green - 4 points       Aqua - 1 point           Blue - 1 point

The first player or team to completely destroy both walls OR score the
most points after playing five balls wins the game.  Score the maximum
number of points, 864, when you destroy both walls.

In other games, you must rely on the speed of your game skill.  A timer
records the cumulative minutes and seconds of each of your turns
during a game.  The team or player who destroys both walls with five
balls in the least amount of time with five balls wins the game. [sic]
In one-player games, try to break your own time records.


HANDICAP (DIFFICULTY SWITCH)

In ""B"" position the paddle is 3/4 the size of the paddle when the
switch is in the ""A"" position.  Where there are two players on one
team, one difficulty switch will affect both paddles.


CONTROLLER ACTION

To Serve the Ball:
Press the red controller button and the ball will appear.

To Move the Paddles:
To move the paddles across the playfield, turn the controller knob.
Turn it clockwise to move the paddle to the right; turn it counter
clockwise to move the paddle to the left.

To Steer the Balls:
Some Breakout and Breakthru games will feature Steerable Balls.  In
these games you can control the direction of the control knob
clockwise to move the ball to the right; turn it counter-clockwise to
move the ball to the left.

To Catch the Ball:
Some Breakout and Breakthru games feature Catch.  When the ball makes
contact with your paddle, press the red controller.  Continue to press
the button and the ball will remain on the paddle, allowing you more
time to carefully aim your shots.  To release the ball, release the red
controller button.


BREAKOUT GAMES

GAME 1
Using a controller, players attempt to smash their way through the
wall and score points.

GAME 2
This game features Steerable Balls so you can make every hit count.

GAME 3
Take a breather.  This game features Catch, which gives you time to
play your strategy and aim.

GAME 4
Don't blink.  The only time you'll see your Breakout wall is when the
ball hits a brick.  The rest of the time you're playing Breakout in the
dark.

GAME 5
The pressure's on.  The Time at the top of the playfield will record
the time it takes you to complete a Breakout.

GAME 6
The Timer provides the suspense.  The Steerable Balls provide some of
the strategy moves you'll make during this game.

GAME 7
How long does it take?  The Time in this game will tick away the
seconds as you aim your balls with Catch.

GAME 8
The wall lights up only when you hit a brick.  Then you're playing in
the dark again as the Timer records your game time.


BREAKTHRU GAMES

Breakthru is played the same way as Breakout games.  The only
difference is the ball action.  Once the ball hits a brick, the ball
continues to penetrate the wall, hitting more bricks and scoring more
points.  Breakthru is plenty of fast ball and paddle action.

GAME 9
POW!  POW!  POW!  Make a direct hit on a brick and the ball continues
traveling through the wall in this basic Breakthru.

GAME 10
Steerable missiles increase your control over the ball during this
fast game of Breakthru.

GAME 11
Slow the action down with Catch in this Breakthru game.

GAME 12
The Breakthru wall only appears when you hit a brick.  During any other
game play it's invisible.


PLAYING TIPS

o    The paddle is divided into five sections.  Note that the ball
     bounces off each section at progressively smaller angles after
     the third, seventh, and eleventh hit.  After the twelfth hit,
     the angle returns to its original size.

o    The ball will speed up after the twelfth consecutive hit OR when
     it hits any brick in the top three rows.  (Speed Bricks)

o    When the ball makes contact with the center section of the
     paddle, the ball will jump.

1. **Insert the Cartridge**: Make sure your Atari system is turned off. Insert the Demon Attack cartridge into the cartridge slot with the label facing up. Push down firmly until the cartridge is securely in place.
2. **Turn On the System**: Flip the power switch to the ""ON"" position. The game will load, and you should see the title screen.

### Controls
- **Joystick**: Use the joystick to move your laser cannon left and right at the bottom of the screen. 
- **Button**: Press the joystick button to fire your laser cannon.

### Game Selection
- **Game Variations**: Use the ""Game Select"" switch to choose from different game variations. Each game variation offers a unique challenge.
- **Difficulty Settings**: Use the ""Difficulty"" switches to set the difficulty level for single or two-player games. ""B"" is easier and ""A"" is more challenging.

## Gameplay

### Objectives
- **Survive and Score**: Your primary objective is to survive the waves of attacking demons and achieve the highest score possible.
- **Destroy Demons**: Aim and fire your laser cannon to destroy the demons before they can destroy you. Each hit demon will give you points.

### Scoring
- Each demon destroyed will score points. The higher the wave level, the more points each demon is worth.
- Bonus points may be awarded for surviving particularly difficult waves.

### Lives
- You start the game with a set number of lives. Each time you are hit by a demon's attack, you lose a life.
- The game ends when all your lives have been lost.

## Tips for Playing

- **Stay Mobile**: Keep your laser cannon moving to avoid incoming fire and to position yourself for a better shot.
- **Focus Fire**: Concentrate on one demon at a time. Destroying them quickly can prevent them from overwhelming you.
- **Watch Patterns**: Pay attention to the attack patterns of the demons. They often move in predictable ways which can help you anticipate and dodge their attacks.

## Game Variations

- **Single-Player and Two-Player Modes**: Demon Attack can be played solo or with a friend in alternating turns. The two-player mode allows for cooperative competition where each player tries to achieve the highest score.
- **Advanced Levels**: As you progress through the game, you’ll face more challenging levels with faster and more aggressive demons.

## Warranty
This video game cartridge is warranted against any defects in material and workmanship for a period of 90 days from the date of purchase. If a defect covered by this warranty occurs during this period, Imagic will repair or replace the cartridge free of charge.

destroy them, or be destroyed!  Armed with your Laser Cannon, you confront the
ultimate challenge:  SURVIVE!

OBJECTIVE

Destroy demons and accumulate points before you and your LASER CANNON meet
with oblivion.  Keep RESERVE BUNKERS intact and increase their number by
avoiding your foes' fire.  When the last bunker disintegrates, the next enemy
hit will pulverize you!

GAME PLAY

Your LASER CANNON has unlimited firing power.

Dodge left or right to avoid enemy fire while pursuing aliens.

Accumulate RESERVE BUNKERS (bottom left of screen).  You begin with 3.

Each attack wave you survive completely unscathed earns you an additional
bunker, to a maximum of 6.

Every hit you absorb destroys an additional bunker.

When all bunkers disappear, another alien barrage will vaporize you.

HAND CONTROLS

Your JOYSTICK CONTROLLER allows you to manuver.  Position controller so that
the RED FIRING BUTTON rests in the upper left-hand corner.  To move the LASER
CANNON LEFT, push joystick LEFT; for RIGHT mobility, lean joystick RIGHT.

GAME OBJECTIVE
------------
The objective of Freeway is to guide a chicken across a 10-lane highway filled with oncoming traffic and reach the safety of the other side. Players score points every time they successfully get their chicken to the other side of the road. The game can be played solo or with two players.

------------
GAME SETUP
------------
1. Insert the Freeway game cartridge into your Atari console.
2. Turn on the console and select either a one-player or two-player mode using the game select switch.

------------
GAME CONTROL
------------
- Use the joystick to control your chicken:
  - Push the joystick up to move your chicken forward.
  - Release the joystick to stop moving.
- There are no left, right, or backward movements - only forward.

------------
GAMEPLAY
------------
1. Upon starting the game, your chicken appears at the bottom of the screen.
2. Traffic moving horizontally across the screen consists of multiple speeds and vehicle types.
3. Your goal is to navigate through the traffic to reach the top of the screen.
4. Each successful crossing scores one point.

------------
RULES AND STRATEGIES
------------
- Avoid getting hit by vehicles, as your chicken will be pushed back to the bottom or the beginning of the lane where it was struck.
- Timing and patience are essential. Observe the traffic patterns to find openings.
- Vehicles move at varying speeds; learn their patterns to improve your chances.

------------
SCORING
------------
- 1 point is awarded each time you successfully cross the highway.
- The game keeps track of the number of times the chicken reaches the other side within a given time frame.

------------
SPECIAL FEATURES
------------

------------
GAME VARIATIONS
------------
Different game variations can be selected using the game select switch:
- Varied traffic speeds and patterns provide different levels of difficulty.
- In two-player mode, choose variations where both chickens face identical or non-identical traffic patterns.

------------
END OF GAME
------------
The game ends when the timer runs out. The player (or players) with the highest score wins.

------------
TIPS
------------
- Focus on one lane at a time, waiting for a clear path.
- Practice makes perfect. The more you play, the better you'll understand the traffic patterns.

Enjoy playing Freeway and test your dexterity and timing against the challenge of crossing the busy highway. Good luck!","FREEWAY TM

INSTRUCTIONS

If you think driving on a busy freeway is intense...wait 'till
you try to cross it on foot! In Freeway by ACTIVISION, your
challenge is to guide a chicken across ten lanes of the most
perilous freeway traffic imaginable. Be careful, because those
speeding cars and trucks don't brake for animals! So, before
you start the chicken across the road, take a minute to read
these instructions. You'll find out how to score points by
leading your fearless fowl to safety without getting his
feathers ruffled by a ""semi"".

ACTIVISION TM

FREEWAY BASICS

1.   Hook up your video game system. Follow the manufacturer's
     instruction.

2.   With power OFF, plug in the game cartridge.

3.   Turn power ON. If no picture appears, check connection of
     your game system to TV, then repeat steps 1-3.

4.   Plug in Joystick Controllers.

5.   Set difficulty switches at b (down) position.

6.   Select game with game select switch. In all games, there
     are ten lanes of traffic, five in each direction.
          Game 1:   Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, 3 A.M.
          Game 2:   Interstate 5, Seattle, 6 A.M.
          Game 3:   Santa Monica Freeway, Los Angeles, 10 A.M.
          Game 4:   Bayshore Freeway, San Francisco, Midnight
          Game 5:   John Lodge Expressway, Detroit, 9 P.M.
          Game 6:   The Beltway, Washington D.C., 6 P.M.
          Game 7:   LBJ Freeway, Dallas, 5 P.M.
          Game 8:   Long Island Expressway, New York City, 3  
                    A.M.
          (See descriptions under ""Special Features."")

7.   Use of Joystick Controllers. The left Joystick controls
     the chicken on the left. The right Joystick controls the
     chicken on the right. Hold Joystick with red button at
     upper left. Pushing the Joystick forward moves your
     chicken ahead (up). Pulling the Joystick back moves your
     chicken back (down). Your chicken can move forward and
     backward only, not side-to-side. The red button has no
     effect.

8.   Difficulty switches. With the difficulty switch in the b
     (down) position, your chicken is knocked back one lane
     when struck by a vehicle. With the switch in the a (up)
     position, your chicken will return to the curb (the
     beginning) after being struck by a vehicle. The left
     difficulty switch is for the left player; the right
     switch is for the right player. Start with difficulty
     switches in the b (down) position; a (up) is for more
     advanced players.

9.   To begin play. Press game reset. One or two players may
     play in any game.

10.  Scoring/Timing. Each time you guide your chicken
     successfully across the freeway, you are awarded one
     point. The score for each player is indicated at the top
     of the screen, directly above each player's chicken.
     There are two minutes and sixteen seconds in each game.
     When the score begins to flash, eight seconds of playing
     time remain. At the end of each game, the traffic comes
     to a stop and the final score is shown. Whoever scores
     the most points is a winner.

                                   novice.

SPECIAL FEATURES OF FREEWAY TM BY ACTIVISION TM

When game reset is pressed, the traffic in the game you've
selected begins to move. This motion is accompanied by sounds
associated with a typical freeway: the drone of auto and truck
engines, the honks from the horns of the vehicles. Each game
has its own combination of these sounds.

Should your chicken get hit, he'll chirp and be knocked back
either one lane or all the way back to the beginning
(depending on where you've set your difficulty switch). He
always gets up, though, and is ready to try again.

[Screen shot with arrows indicating SCORES, TRAFFIC,
CHICKENS.]

GAMES

Each game offers a different challenge. The type, speed and
frequency of traffic may vary, depending on the game.


     GAME ONE: LAKE SHORE DRIVE, CHICAGO, 3 A.M.
Automobiles only. Traffic is thin. Speeds are relatively slow.
Autos move slowest in lanes closest to curbs, then faster with
each lane closer to center of highway.

     GAME TWO: INTERSTATE 5, SEATTLE, 6 A.M.
Upper lane closest to center of freeway has trucks; all others
have autos. Traffic is thicker and moves faster than in Game
One. Speeds of autos increase in the same order as they did in
Game one.

     GAME THREE: SANTA MONICA FREEWAY, LOS ANGELES, 10 A.M.
Trucks are now in both center lanes. These trucks are the
fastest moving vehicles, and they move faster than the fastest
moving vehicles in Games One and Two. Traffic is thicker in
the two lanes closest to the curbs.

     GAME FOUR: BAYSHORE FREEWAY, SAN FRANCISCO, MIDNIGHT
There are trucks in all lanes. The trucks in the lanes closest
to center, as well as those closest to the curbs, move at the
same speed as the trucks in Game Three. The trucks in lanes 2
and 4 move at half the speed of those in lanes 1 and 5. The
trucks in lane 3 are the slowest, and move at half the speed
of those in lanes 2 and 4. (Lane at bottom of screen is lane
1; lane at top is lane 10.)

     GAMES FIVE THROUGH EIGHT
Similar to Games One through Four in the amount of traffic for
each game. But, take care, because the speeds of the vehicles
are increased and decreased at random throughout each of these
games - without regard to lane. You'll really have to be on
your toes, because you can never tell when the speed of any
particular traffic will change.

GETTING THE FEEL OF FREEWAY TM BY ACTIVISION TM

The objective in Freeway by ACTIVISION is to score as many
points as you can by guiding your chicken across the ten lanes
of traffic as many times as possible in two minutes and
sixteen seconds.

For beginners, try Game One (Lake Shore Drive) with the
difficulty switches in the b (down) position. Get the feel of
how your chicken responds to your Joystick. Since the traffic
flow in Game One is relatively light, you have ample time to
react to oncoming vehicles. You want to guide your chicken
across the freeway as quickly as possible, but you don't want
to put him where he can't avoid an oncoming vehicle. You will
need to be aware of traffic not only in the lane closest to
your chicken, but also in the lanes on either side.

After you get the feel of Game One, try your hand at some of
the tougher highways. And, when you're really feeling bold,
put your difficulty switch up to a and watch out!

Freeway by ACTIVISION is a game of anticipation and timing.
After awhile, you'll learn to judge traffic flow and make the
right move at the right time. Sometimes that means bravely
forging ahead. And, at other times, that will mean sitting
back and waiting for just the right opening.

JOIN THE ACTIVISION ""SAVE THE CHICKEN FOUNDATION""

Activision wants to recognize your traffic dodging
achievements. So, if you're successful in guiding your chicken
through traffic at least 20 times in either Game Three or Game
Seven, you can become an official member of the Activision
""Save the Chicken Foundation."" Send us a picture of your TV
screen showing your accomplishment, and we'll enroll you and
send you a special membership emblem.

HOW TO BECOME AN ACE ""CHICKEN CROSSER"" IN FREEWAY TM BY
ACTIVISION TM
Tips from David Crane, designer of Freeway

David Crane is also the designer of Dragster TM, Fishing Derby
TM and Laser Blast TM by ACTIVISION. He consistently comes up
with highly unusual, imaginative and challenging games. 

[Nice photo of Crane (same one that appears in the 1982
Activision games catalog.)]

""As unusual as Freeway is, you still will have to employ some
tried and true gaming skills to do well at it. For instance,
you must become familiar with the different traffic patterns
in order to anticipate and make the right moves. This is
especially difficult in Games Five through Eight, where
traffic speeds can change instantly.

""You'll notice that clusters of vehicles in each lane travel
at generally the same distance apart, at the same speed. If a
cluster happens to be in a fast lane, you'll have to plan in
advance how you're going to get through without being hit.

""Succeeding at Freeway will depend on your ability to develop
quick reflexes to avoid the traffic and ""hit the hole"" at just
the right time. Have fun and watch the traffic!

""Drop me a line. I'd like to hear about your exploits.""

                     ARCTIC ARCHITECT'S HANDBOOK

                           Activision (R)


The object of the game is to help Frostbite Bailey (TM) build igloos 
by jumping on floating blocks of ice.  Be careful to avoid these 
deadly hazards: clams, snowgeese, Alaskan king crab, grizzly polar 
bears, and the rapidly dropping temperature.


FROSTBITE (TM) BASICS

1. Insert game cartridge into your video game console with power OFF.
   Then, turn power ON.

2. Plug in Joystick Controller/s.  Solo player uses left Joystick.

3. The difficulty switches are not used.

4. Select game with game select switch.

   Game 1 - Regular      Game 2 - Regular, Two Players
   Game 3 - Advanced     Game 4 - Advanced, Two Players

   Regular games start at level 1.  Advanced games start at level 5.

5. The Joystick Controller is held with the red button in the upper
   left position.

   * To move Frostbite Bailey left or right, move Joystick left or
     right.

   * He'll move up when you push the Joystick forward, and move down
     when you pull it back.

   * To reverse the direction of the ice floe [sic] you are standing
     on, press the red button.  But remember, each time you do, your
     igloo will lose a block, unless its completely built.

6. To begin a new game, press the game reset.  The ice will start to
   move and Frostbite can start jumping.

7. Reserves.  You begin the game with one active Frostbite Bailey
   (TM) and three on reserve.   With each increase of 5,000 points,
   a bonus Frostbite is added to your reserves (up to a maximum of
   nine).

8. Frostbite gets lost each time he falls into the Arctic Sea, gets
   chased away by a Polar Grizzly, or gets caught outside when the
   temperature drops to zero.

(Picture of the game)


IGLOO CONSTRUCTION

Building Codes.  Each time Frostbite Bailey (TM) jumps onto a white 
ice floe, a ""block"" is added to the igloo.  Once jumped upon, the 
white ice turns blue.  It can still be jumped on, but it won't add 
points to your score or blocks to your igloo.  When all four rows are 
blue, they turn white again.  The igloo is complete when the door 
appears.  Frostbite may then jump into it.

Work Hazards.  Avoid contact with Alaskan King Crabs, snow geese, and 
killer clams, as they will push Frostbite Bailey into the fatal 
Arctic Sea.  The Polar Grizzlies come out of hibernation at level 4 
and, upon contact, will chase Frostbite right off-screen (note: 
actually left off-screen:).


SPECIAL FEATURES OF FROSTBITE

Fresh Fish swim by regularly.  They are Frostbite's only food, and, 
as such, are also additives to your score.  Catch 'em if you can.

Night and Day.  Frostbite works the day shift and the night shift.  
He must build four igloos per shift.

A Magic Fish will appear near your score when you've racked up a 
certain high number of points.  Watch for it!

LIFE AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD

The Arctic probably ranks as the area least chosen by homebuyers, and 
most of us know little, if anything, about this amazing land.  Yet, 
the Arctic has been home to some of the happiest and healthiest 
members of humankind for thousands of years--the Eskimos!

Traditional Eskimos believe that nature's gift belong to everyone.  
There is no private property except for tools and clothes.  
Everything else is shared--not only with community members, but with 
any stranger that travels by!

It is only while traveling that Eskimos live in their famous snow 
houses.  All houses are called ""igloos"" whether they are made of 
wood, fur, mud, or snow.  The snow variety can be built in about one 
hour.  Here's how:

A knife with a long, wife blade is used to cut snow into blocks 
measuring 36"" x 18"" x 6"".  These are piled in a continuous spiral.

The entrance is a tunnel under the snow or, when the ground is 
frozen, a long hall, above-ground.  This keeps out the cold wind, and 
keeps the warm air inside.  A hole is made in the roof for 
ventilation.

There are fascinating things to learn from our Arctic sisters and 
brothers.  Find out more at your library.


HOW TO BECOME AN ARCTIC ARCHITECT

Tips from Steve Cartwright, designer of Frostbite (TM)

/Steve Cartwright is an Activision senior designer.  His prolific 
talents have already brought you Barnstorming (TM), Megamania (TM), 
Seaquest (TM), and Plaque Attack (TM).  Aside from video games, Steve 
enjoys motorcycle touring and photography./

""Here are my favorite tips for high scoring:

""Learn to use the red button sparingly.  The best time to use it is 
to 'fake out' the bear by drawing him to the middle of the screen and 
quickly changing direction.

""Don't be greedy with the fish.  Get them if they come by.  However, 
going out of your way often uses too much time.

""Another thing: You can move Frostbite Bailey in mid-air and, at the 
higher levels, you can really hook him around.  Check out just how 
far he'll go.

""Notice that hazards only get you when both feet are planted.  
Therefore, it's possible to jump 'around' hazards since they can't 
hurt you in mid-air.

""Now here's a secret tip I've decided to share: If you jump up onto 
the extreme left of the shore, the bear can't get you.  It's 
Frostbite's emergency hide-out.

""Now that you know the inside scoop, I'm expecting some really high 
scores.  But don't stay on the ice too long: You can't write when 
your hands are cold.  And, at the very least, I'm expecting a 
postcard.""

PERIL IS MY MIDDLE NAME

""Roderick Hero here (R.Hero to my associates), President and Chief
Executive Officer of H.E.R.O., Inc., inviting you to join me in tackling
a tricky maze of mine shafts rife with the kind of danger we daring types
only dream of. Until now, that is!
""Think of it: miners trapped in a mountain bubbling with lava rivers
and magma deposits, mine shafts crawling with vile vermin, all lethal to
the touch. Oh, it's just too awful ----- and too exciting!
""I'm armed with equipment of my own invention. My Prop-pack carries me
to even deeper depths, while I zap creepy critters with my Microlaser Beam.
Dynamite demolishes walls that get in my way. If my supply lasts, that is.
And my power.
""Did I mention the terrible tentacles that loom up out of lava? Or the
massive walls that can crush me? What about the raft I ride on? Oh, never
mind. Come along, and make yourself useful.""


H.E.R.O.
GAME PROGRAM INSTRUCTIONS

DUTY CALLS!

Roderick Hero, at you service. Please, call me R.Hero. Everyone does,
I wish to address myself to fledgling Heroes and All-Round Good Guys every-
where. A crisis is afoot, affording me an ideal opportunity to share a few
of the finer points of heroic endeavor with you. Do pay attention.
Volcanic activity has trapped miners in mineshafts in Mount Leone. I
shall use equipment (some think it rather nifty) of my own invention to help
miners no mere mortal can reach. It would give me great pleasure to have
your help.
The object of this undertaking is to rescue all the miners possible
before running out of lives.

MAKING READY!

Do follow these simple instructions. There's a good fellow.

* Insert cartridge. Turn power ON.

* Plug in the Left Joystick controller (see ""Essentials"" for use).

* Select one of five one-player games with the game select switch.
The higher the game number, the deeper within the mine one begins and
the more advanced the challenge. (See ""Rescue Challenge Chart"".)

* To start, press game reset. Note how Yours Truly hovers in a mine-
shaft, ready to go once the power gauge turns completely yellow. One
need only move the Joystick to begin.

* Reserves. I embark with four opportunities ---- very well then ""Lives""
---- one in use, three in reserve. One aquires an additional life, to a
maximum of six in reserve, for every 20,000 points earned.

* Power Gauge. One hears and sees the power gauge fill at the start of
each level. Power begins to diminish when the Joystick is moved at the
beginning of each level or after a reserve life appears on the screen.
If power runs out and a reserve life remains, one reappears at the
top of that level.

* Game ends when one runs out of lives, of course.

SOME ESSENTIALS

""Must haves"" for the rescuer in the know.

Prop-Pack. My greatest inspiration, to which I'm very attached. This prop-
eller pack allows one to fly where one wishes.
* To fly up: Push joystick forward.
* To run or fly left or right: Move joystick left or right.
* To hover: Tap joystick forward.
* To fly down a shaft: Step off the ledge. Gravity does the rest!

Microlaser Beam. The helmet comes equipped with a Microlaser Beam. With it
one can blast vile vermin. The Beam can also slice through walls, but this
takes time and time costs precious power.
* To fire: Press Joystick button.
* For continuous fire: Press and hold button.

Dynamite. One begins each game and every mineshaft level with six sticks of
dynamite, each of which can demolish a small wall.
* Land and move near a wall.
* To place and ignite dynamite: Pull joystick toward you. Then move fast
or be blown up! I, R.Hero, cannot stress this enough.

Raft. A heat-resistant raft floats on certain stretches of the lava river.
If it can carry R.Hero across the river when he lands on it (it can), it
can carry you. A word to the wise: Getting off isn't always easy!


[SCREEN SHOT SHOWING PRINCIPAL ELEMENTS OF R.HERO'S ENVIRONMENT]



PLANNING THE PERFECT OUTING

One should make it a point to be as familiar with the details of a
rescue operation as with guests in one's home. To wit:

Meet the mineshaft. Mineshafts extend vertically and horizontally deep into
Mount Leone. Some dead end; others are blocked by walls. Some walls and
surfaces glow red; these contain magma deposits, molten lava behind the rock.
Like lava rivers, magma deposits cost one a life should one be careless
enough to touch them. Oh yes, before I forget Lanterns light these murky
mineshafts. Touch or shoot one and that section of the mine will go dark.
Most unpleasant.

Hello to Hazards. The shafts, you will note, are alive with various vermin:
Springing spiders, shaft bats, mine moths and nesting snakes. Do avoid them,
or blast the loathsome little beggars with the Microlaser Beam. In addition
a tentacle traces one's every move over certain parts of the lava river. As
one cannot shoot it, practice caution. Touching any of these hazards results
in a loss of life, alas.

How Low Can One Go? One must locate a miner on each level before moving
lower in the mine. The deeper one goes, the faster things move, the more
dangerous and numerous the challenges become and the harder it is to find
the miner. The current level number appears in place of the score at the
beginning of each level. To tackle tougher tunnels right away, one may start
the rescue mission at deeper levels.

*Game 5 starts on level 17, but all following levels are random. No level
number appears during game 5.

In games 1 to 4, the word PRO appears in place of the level number after
level 20. My highest accolade, you can be sure!

SCORING

* Shoot a critter: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .50 points
* Each dynamite stick remaining
   when miner is rescued: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .50 points
* Dynamite a wall: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 75 points
* Rescue miner: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1000 points

One earns additional points for every unit of power remaining when a miner is
rescued. The higher the level number, the more each unit of power is worth.

The day has been saved when the score reaches 1,000,000. The rescue operation
ceases. Can you say what else happens? R.Hero, of course, knows........


H.E.R.O. HINTS FOR THE HEARTY HERO
Tips from John Van Ryzin

(John Van Ryzin collects cameras. He golfs. He camps, and goes canoeing. In
addition, he's from New Jersey. But what you must understand about John is,
he loves his work. He thrives on it. As proof of this, he belongs to almost
every Activision club. No mean feat, that.)

""The mineshafts of Mount Leone present many challenges to a rescuer. I
recommend you watch the opening sequence before playing the game. It'll
give you a feel for the terrain and help you recognize some of the dangers
ahead. Also, the more you play, the better you'll learn your way around
the different mineshafts. Since speed in locating miners earns you more
points, you'll want to move as quickly and efficiently as possible. Here
are a few tips I think you might find useful.

* The dynamite R.Hero carries is potent. He doesn't need to be right
next to a wall in order to blow it up.

* If R.Hero runs out of dynamite, he can burn through walls with the
Microlaser Beam. The closer he stands to the wall, the faster he'll
break through.

* If a lantern goes out, find mineshafts by looking at the rough edges
along the bottom of the screen.

* When flying above the river, ride the ceiling by pushing up as well as
to the left or right.

* Ride rafts whenever possible since it is easier than trying to go
under a lava ceiling.

* A word about tentacles: They don't move too fast, so try to outrun
them.

Hope that helps some. You'll discover your own techniques as you plumb the
depths of the mine. Let me hear what they are when you emerge from `down
under'.""

MONTEZUMA?S REVENGE

PANAMA JOE, That?s what they call him ?round these parts; though no one knows his real name or where he comes from.  But one thing?s for sure,  PANAMA JOE?s a daredevil from the word ?go!?  No risk?s too great if the reward?s large enough.  Winning.  That?s what?s the most important to him.  And more times than not, that?s exactly what he does.  Because he?s tough, clever ? resourceful.  And sometimes, downright pig-headed!  Though occasionally (ah-hum), he?s been known to get in over his head.  Luckily, he?s got a knack for getting himself out of hot water as quickly as he gets into it!  Let?s hope MONTEZUMA?S REVENGE is one of those times.

OBJECT

To help PANAMA JOE safely reach Montezuma?s fantastic treasure by guiding him through a maze of death-dealing chambers within the emperor?s fortress.  Along the way, PANAMA JOE must avoid an array of deadly creatures while he collects valuables and tools which can aid him in mastering the evils of the fortress and eventually, escaping with the  loot!

SETTING THE CONTROLS
1.        Place the cartridge firmly into the cartridge slot.
2.        Turn the ON/OFF switch to ON.
3.        The first screen to appear will feature PANAMA JOE in the center of the first chamber.  Now, you?re ready to start the action.

THE JOYSTICK
Because this is a one-player game, plug the joystick firmly into the LEFT jack only.

Use your joystick to move PANAMA JOE through the emperor?s fortress.  To make PANAMA JOE walk left or right, move the joystick in those directions.  To make him climb up a ladder or chain, push forward on the joystick; to climb down, pull backwards on the joystick.

NOTE:  you?ll discover that a combination of left/right and backwards/forwards joystick movements will make guiding PANAMA JOE on and off ladders and chains easier 

THE FIRE BUTTON
Press the FIRE button any time you want PANAMA JOE to jump.  If PANAMA JOE is standing still, he will jump straight up and down, if he is moving left or right, PANAMA JOE will leap in that direction.

SCREEN DISPLAYS
At the top, center portion of the screen there are 5 hats representing your remaining number of PANAMA JOEs.  Each time you lose a PANAMA JOE, one hat disappears.  You?ll begin the game with 6 PANAMA JOEs, including the one on screen.

In the space directly beneath the 5 hats is a box called the INVENTORY WINDOW.  Each time PANAMA JOE collects a special tool (e.g., a sword, torch, or a key), that tool is displayed in the Inventory Window until he finishes using it.

In the space over the 5 hats is the SCORE BOX.

Throughout the game, points will be accumulated and your score will be displayed in this space (see SCORING section).

PLAYING
Once you start this game, your are PANAMA JOE-winding your way through MONTEZUMA?S fortress!  That means you?ve got to be ready to handle lots of action.  Like climbing ladders and chains.  Jumping over (and under) deadly creatures.  And grabbing precious jewels and special tools along the way.  No sweat, right?  You?ll be ready for anything because, like PANAMA JOE, you thrive on the spirit of adventure and exploration.  Maybe you?ll need to backtrack through certain chambers.  Or perhaps forge ahead blindly.  Even test you memory to remember the location of a room you fought through earlier.  Just be sure to keep a cool head.  Use your special tools wisely.  And please ? try not to let greed blind you as you snatch up MONTEZUMA?s fabulous treasures.  Happy hunting, PANAMA JOE!

INSIDE MONTEZUMA?S FORTRESS
As you guide PANAMA JOE through Montezuma?s fortress, you?ll encounter 3 major groups of elements.  They are:

?         Room Fixtures
?         Killer Creatures
?         Special Tools & Rewards

Various combinations of these elements are found in all the chambers throughout the fortress.  Each is described as follows:

ROOM FIXTURES

LASER GATES  Destructive laser gates intermittently appear and disappear in various parts of a chamber.  PANAMA JOE must avoid these laser gates, and pass through ONLY when they disappear.  IF PANAMA JOE HITS A LASER GATE, YOU LOSE HIM.

CONVEYOR BELTS  Conveyor belts force PANAMA JOE to speed up or slow down, depending upon the direction in which he is moving.  In general, if you move the joystick IN THE DIRECTION OPPOSITE to which the conveyor is moving, PANAMA JOE will slow down while moving against the conveyor.  If PANAMA JOE is heading in the SAME DIRECTION as the conveyor, he will speed across to the other side where, at times, you must safely jump him off.  IF PANAMA JOE MISSES JUMPING ONTO OR OFF OF A CONVEYOR BELT, YOU LOSE HIM.

DISAPPEARING FLOORS  in the same chambers, there are certain sections of the floor which look different from the rest.  These sections intermittently appear and disappear.  You must time PANAMA JOE?s crossing of these sections just right or?IF HE FALLS TOO FAR, OR FALLS INTO A FIRE PIT, YOU LOSE THAT PANAMA JOE.

DOORS  Throughout the fortress you?ll encounter yellow or blue doors.  These doors can ONLY be opened when PANAMA JOE approaches them with a key (displayed in the Inventory Window).  YOU GAIN 300 POINTS FOR OPENING ANY DOOR.

FIRE PITS  Occasionally, PANAMA JOE will come across a blazing fire pit as he maneuvers through a chamber.  Fire pits must be avoided at all costs!  Time your crossing carefully, OR YOU?LL LOSE PANAMA JOE TO A PUFF OF SMOKE 

LADDERS  Ladders allow PANAMA JOE to travel up to, or down from one level to the next.  Simply move the joystick in the appropriate direction.

CHAINS  Much like ladders, chains offer PANAMA JOE a way to travel from on level to the next.  Simply jump PANAMA JOE onto a chain and guide him up or down by using your joystick.

KILLER CREATURES

SKULLS  In his travels, PANAMA JOE will come across bouncing and rolling skulls.  He must jump over the rolling skulls, and walk under the bouncing ones.  IF PANAMA JOE IS HIT BY A SKULL, YOU LOSE HIM.  But, if he has a sword (displayed in the Inventory Window), PANAMA JOE can eliminate a skull by simply walking through it.  YOU GAIN 2000 POINTS FOR ELIMINATING A SKULL.

SNAKES  Watch out for the snakes!  Though they don?t move, they have a deadly bite.  Whenever PANAMA JOE meets up with one, he must jump over it.  Not even a sword will eliminate a snake.  IF PANAMA JOE IS BITTEN, YOU LOSE HIM.

SPIDERS  Unlike snakes, spiders do get around.  IF ONE BITES PANAMA JOE, YOU LOSE HIM.  So PANAMA JOE must either jump over spiders, or slay them with a sword (displayed in the Inventory Window).  YOU?LL GAIN 3000 POINTS FOR SLAYING A SPIDER.

SPECIAL TOOLS & REWARDS
As PANAMA JOE works his way through the fortress, he?ll encounter special tools and rewards ? all there for his taking.  When possible, PANAMA JOE should jump up and grab a special item, which will then be displayed in the Inventory Window until it is used.  The Inventory Window can only hold 4 items at a time.  Once it is filled, PANAMA JOE cannot collect any more special items.

The 5 special tools and rewards are:

AMULET  This hammer shaped object helps PANAMA JOE evade killer creatures.  Whenever he grabs the amulet, all killer creatures are disabled for several seconds ? allowing PANAMA JOE to safely walk through them.  He can even travel into another chamber during this time.  Once this time is up, the amulet will disappear from the Inventory Window and the killer creatures will return to their nasty, normal ? colored selves.  COLLECTING AN AMULET IS WORTH 200 POINTS.

JEWELS  These dazzling beauties are worth 1000 points apiece!  PANAMA JOE simply jumps up and plucks them as he goes by.  However, if the Inventory Window contains 4 items, PANAMA JOE cannot collect more jewels ? even though jewels are not displayed in the Window.

KEYS  To every door in the fortress ? there?s a key.  And the only way to get these keys is by helping PANAMA JOE grab them along the way.  Keys will be displayed in the Inventory Window until used.  YOU GAIN 100 POINTS FOR GRABBING A KEY AND 300 POINTS FOR OPENING A DOOR.

SWORD  A SWORD IN THE HAND IS WORTH 100 POINTS ? so be sure not to pass it up along the way.  More important, a sword enables PANAMA JOE to eliminate a spider or a skull on contact.

TORCH  Don?t underestimate the necessity of a torch.  As PANAMA JOE travels deeper into the fortress, he may encounter dark chambers.  Only with the torch can he illuminate these hazardous rooms.  Once PANAMA JOE has the torch, he keeps it throughout the current game level.  Without the torch, there is no light at all ? and you must rely on your memory to guide PANAMA JOE safely through these chambers.  GRABBING A TORCH EARNS YOU 300 POINTS.

THE TREASURE ROOM
If PANAMA JOE safely navigates through all of the chambers in the fortress, he?ll eventually reach his ultimate goal ? the Treasure Chamber.  Herein lies the fabulous treasure of the emperor, Montezuma!

Once inside, PANAMA JOE will see the infamous jewels flashing.  In just several seconds, he must collect as many jewels as possible.  When this time is up, you?ll automatically advance to the next Difficulty Level.

END OF GAME
The game ends when you?ve lost all of you PANAMA JOEs.  When this happens, PANAMA JOE will disappear and all action on the screen will stop. 

To play again, simply press the RESET switch, or the FIRE button on the joystick controller.

                    1. THE BEAUTY QUEEN OF VIDEO GAMES

{picture credited to GUS ALLEN}

By now you've probably spent some time playing the master of mazes --
PAC-MAN *. Well, lookout PAC-MAN lovers, ATARI is proud to bring you the
""femme fatale"" of computer video game world -- MS. PAC-MAN!

That's right, she's here in all her shining glory. MS. PAC-MAN is sure to
steal your heart with her grace and charm.

* Trademark of Bally Midway Mfg. Co. licensed by Namco-America, Inc.

And she's all dolled up with a ribbon in her hair. Just like the arcade
MS. PAC-MAN, this ATARI home version has multiple mazes, floating fruit,
pretzels, an end-of-game cartoon, and four fearless ghosts -- Inky, Blinky,
Pinky, and Sue.

Get ready to feast your eyes on the original video beauty queen. She's
ready to bring you many delightful hours of fun and excitement. So,
sit back, relax and have a good time playing MS. PAC-MAN.

                               2. GAME PLAY

The object of the game is to score as many points as you can while
MS. PAC-MAN eats dots, fruit, pretzels, energy pills, and ghosts. Score
10,000 points and earn a bonus MS. PAC-MAN life.

The game starts with three MS. PAC-MAN lives, which are indicated by three
MS. PAC-MAN symbols at the lower left corner of the screen. When game play
begins, MS. PAC-MAN is located close to the center of the screen, just
below the ghosts' reincarnation chamber in the center of the maze
(see Figure 1).

Use your Joystick controller to guide MS. PAC-MAN around the maze. When
she passes over dots, she gobbles them up, and you score points. If she
eats all the dots on the screen, the maze flashes momentarily, and you
start playing on a new maze.

Figure 1 {picture of the game screen}

MS. PAC-MAN encounters floating fruit and pretzels while traveling around
the maze. Gobble up these munchies, and you score bonus points. But watch
out! Fearful ghosts scurry about trying to gobble up MS. PAC-MAN. Her only
recourse is to eat an energy pill and then go after the ghosts.

As soon as she gulps down the energy pill, the ghosts turn blue with fright.
You earn 200 points for the first ghost, 400 points for the second ghost,
800 for the third ghost, and a whopping 1600 points for the fourth ghost,
all on the same energy pill. (See Section 6, SCORING, for details about
point values.)

Unfortunately, the effects of the energy pills are short-lived, so you'll
have to move fast. After the ghosts are gobbled up, their eyes head back
to the chamber in the center of the screen for reincarnation. If you don't
gobble up the ghosts, they start to blink just before they turn back to
their original colors.

                         3. USING THE CONTROLLER

Use one Joystick Controller with the ATARI Game Program cartridge. Be sure
to plug the controller cable firmly into the LEFT CONTROLLER jack at the
back of your ATARI 2600 Video Computer System console. Hold the controller
with the red button to your upper left, toward the television screen.
(See your Owner's Manual for further details.)

Use the Joystick to maneuver MS. PAC-MAN up, down, right and left around the
maze. Use it also to slide MS. PAC-MAN in and out of tunnels on both sides
of the maze.

Figure 2 {pointing out all four tunnels}

If MS. PAC-MAN exits on the right, she re-enters on the left; if she exits
on the left, she re-enters on the right (see Figure 2).

                           4. CONSOLE CONTROLS

GAME SELECT SWITCH

Use the GAME SELECT switch to choose the game variation you want to play.
Press this switch and the game variation changes as indicated by the number
in the lower right corner of the screen. Read Section 5, GAME VARIATIONS,
for more information about different game variations. (See Figure 3.)

Figure 3 {pointing out game number}

GAME RESET SWITCH

Once you have selected the game variation you want to play, press the
GAME RESET switch to start the game. Pressing the red controller button
also starts the game.

DIFFICULTY SWITCHES

RIGHT and LEFT DIFFICULTY switches are not used in this game.

TV TYPE SWITCH

Set this switch to COLOR if you're playing on a color television set.
Set it to B-W to play the game on a black and white television.

                            5. GAME VARIATIONS

The ATARI MS. PAC-MAN includes the following four game variations:

CHERRIES:
An arcade version MS. PAC-MAN. Just like the original game, MS. PAC-MAN
is pursued by four ghosts.

ONE BEAR:
A good choice for beginners. MS. PAC-MAN is pursued by only one ghost.

TWO BEARS:
A novice player's choice. MS. PAC-MAN is pursued by only two ghosts.

THREE BEARS:
An intermediate player's choice. MS. PAC-MAN is pursued by only three
ghosts.

All four game variations start at the easiest level, cherries. Games then
progress to the highest level, banana. If you survive the banana level,
the mazes alternate between maze three and maze four. Every two times the
maze is cleared of dots, the fruits are randomly selected, and the time
the ghosts stay blue decreases.

                                6. SCORING

You begin the game with three MS. PAC-MAN lives which are indicated at
the lower left side of the screen. Your score is displayed at the bottom
center of the screen (see Figure 4).

Figure 4 {pointing out score}

You earn a bonus MS. PAC-MAN life after the first 10,000 points you score.

Here's how points are scored:

DOT             10 POINTS
ENERGY PILL     50 POINTS

CHERRY          100 POINTS
STRAWBERRY      200 POINTS
ORANGE          500 POINTS
PRETZEL         700 POINTS
APPLE           1000 POINTS
PEAR            2000 POINTS
BANANA          5000 POINTS

FIRST GHOST     200 POINTS
SECOND GHOST    400 POINTS
THIRD GHOST     800 POINTS
FOURTH GHOST    1600 POINTS

                          7. HINTS FOR SURVIVAL

Practice clearing the maze of dots before trying to gobble up the ghosts.

Stay close to an energy pill before eating it, and tease the ghosts into
moving toward you. When the ghosts get close, eat the energy pill and gobble
up as many ghosts as you can.

Use the openings in the maze as escape tunnels. Move to either side to
quickly evade the ghosts. Don't forget, different mazes have different
tunnels.

Instructions

Picture this!  You are deep in the recesses of a forbidden jungle--an
unforgiving place few explorers ever survive.  But you've got courage, because
you're with Pitfall Harry, the world famous jungle explorer and fortune hunter
extraordinaire.  The lure of hidden treasure draws you and Harry deeper and
deeper into the bush.  But, being a great explorer, you wouldn't think of
starting such a difficult journey without reading this manual first--very
carefully.

PITFALL! BASICS

The object of Pitfall! is to guide Harry through a maze of jungle scenes,
jumping over or avoiding many deadly dangers, and helping Harry grab the most
treasures in the shortest possible time.

1.  Hook up your video game system.  Follow manufacturer's instructions.

2.  With power OFF, plug in game cartridge.

3.  Turn power ON.  If no picture appears, check connection of your game
    system to TV, then repeat steps 1-3.

4.  Plus in left Joystick Controller.  It's the only one you'll need.  When
    playing, hold Joystick with red button in the upper left position.

5.  Difficulty switches and the game select switch are not used in Pitfall!
    Each game is many games in one, with many difficulties to overcome.

6.  To start, press game reset.  Action begins as soon as you move Joystick.

7.  USE OF JOYSTICK CONTROLLER

    --To run left or right...move joystick left or right.

    --To jump over dangers...press the red button while running to the
      right or the left.

    --To climb up or down ladders...push Joystick up to climb, pull down to
      descend.

    --To grab a swinging vine...press the red button while running to the right
      or to the left.

    --To let go of the vine...pull down on Joystick at the end of a swing.

    --To collect a Treasure...just run right to it.

8.  SCORING.  You start each adventure with 2000 points.  Some misfortunes will
    cause a deduction of points.  Should you fall down a hole by accident, you
    will lose 100 points.  Rolling logs will also cause point loss depending on
    how long contact is made with them.

    Each treasure you find will add points to your score.  There are eight of
    each type of treasure in the entire game, 32 in all, for a total of 112,000
    points.  A perfect score is 114,000 points (reached by collecting all
    treasures. without losing any points by falling down holes or tripping on
    logs).

    DIAMOND RING = 5000 POINTS

    GOLD BAR = 4000 POINTS

    SILVER BAR = 3000 POINTS

    MONEY BAG = 2000 POINTS

9.  TIME.  You have 20 minutes to complete each adventure.  Harry has 3 lives
    in each game (See ""The Hazards of Pitfall!"") Game is over when Harry is
    ""lost"" for the third time or when time runs out.

SPECIAL FEATURES OF PITFALL! BY ACTIVISION

There are 255 jungle scenes through which Harry can travel.  Each scene covered
underground is equivalent to three on the surface.  Pitfall! is a circular
maze, which means that, if Harry safely goes through all 255 different scenes,
he will come back to the starting point.  In the course of that journey, Harry
will also encounter all 32 treasures.

  THE HAZARDS OF PITFALL!

    Pitfall Harry's Jungle Adventure is fraught with danger.  Some hazards will
    slow him down and rob you of points, while others will stop him cold in his
    tracks.  The ""lesser"" hazards are the open holes in the ground and rolling
    logs (See ""Scoring"") The catastrophic hazards are the scorpions, fires,
    cobra rattlers, crocodiles, swamps, quicksand and tar pits.  These
    obstacles will not cost you points, BUT they will cost one of Harry's 3
    lives.

GETTING THE FEEL OF PITFALL! BY ACTIVISION

You cannot excell at Pitfall! without acquiring a variety of skills.  The most
important is ""jumping.""  You'll need to use both the red button AND Joystick at
the same time in order to make Harry jump up to a swinging vine.  Jumping is
also important when you leap atop crocodile heads while crossing the swamp OR
when you hurdle over logs, holes, scorpions, fires and snakes.  Special care
should be taken when you jump scorpions; the margin for error is less.

To practice your skills, try running to the right.  Learn to jump the rolling
logs and the holes in the ground first, then tackle the tougher skills of
swinging on the vine and jumping over the crocodile pits.  Whenever Harry is
lost, you'll get another chance to try the hazard again, since the
""replacement"" Harry appears on the left side of the screen.

JOIN PITFALL HARRY'S EXPLORERS' CLUB

If you score 20,000 points (or more) on any one of your adventures with Harry,
you will be eligible to join this prestigious orginization.  Just send us a
picture of your TV screen showing your score, and we'll present you with a
special Explorers' Club membership emblem.

HOW TO SEEK YOUR FORTUNE WITH PITFALL HARRY

Tips from David Crane, designer of Pitfall!

(David Crane is a Senior Designer at Activision.  He also designed Dragster,
Fishing Derby, Laser Blast, Freeway and Grand Prix)

""As you set off on your first adventure with Harry, you'll notice two important
features:  that the logs always roll from right to left, and that the
""replacement"" Harrys (after Harry loses a life) drop from the trees on the left
side of the screen.  So, to minimize the number of rolling logs to be jumped
and the catastrophic hazards to be re-tried, simply run to the left.

""Pitfall Harry's trip must be made through a maze of surface and underground
passages through the jungle.  To capture all 32 treasures in under twenty
minutes, Harry will have to use some of the underground passages.  I'd suggest
that you make a map of the terrain each time you play.  Knowing the jungle
and planning the best route to all treasures is the only way to insure success
time after time.

""Until you get really skilled at making Harry jump from croc to croc, you might
wait until the crocodiles' jaws are closed, jump to the top of the first croc's
head, then wait for the laws to open and close again before jumping to the next
one.  Soon you'll be skipping across crocs like they were stepping stones in a
stream.

""If you can find any writing materials deep in the jungle, drop me a line.  I'd
love to hear how you and Harry are getting along.""

David Crane

Pong,"# Atari Pong Game Manual

## Introduction

Pong is an electronic game released by Atari in 1972, which simulates table tennis (ping-pong). The game features simple two-dimensional graphics and is designed for two players, although a single-player mode is also available.

## Game Objective

The objective of Pong is to defeat your opponent by being the first to score 11 points, achieved by hitting the ball past your opponent's paddle.

## Game Setup

### Equipment Needed
- An Atari console
- Pong game cartridge
- Compatible television set
- Two paddles (controllers)

### Setting Up the Game
1. Connect the Atari console to the television according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Insert the Pong game cartridge into the console.
3. Turn on the television and set it to the appropriate channel for the console.
4. Power on the Atari console.
5. Plug one paddle into the left controller port and the other paddle into the right controller port.

## Basic Controls

### Paddles
- **Left Paddle (Player 1)**: Controlled using the left paddle controller.
- **Right Paddle (Player 2)**: Controlled using the right paddle controller.
- Rotate the knob on the paddle controller to move your on-screen paddle up and down.

## Game Rules

1. **Serve**: The game starts with a serve. The ball will appear in the center of the screen and move toward one player at random.
2. **Returning the Ball**: Each player must use their paddle to hit the ball back to the opponent. The paddles move vertically along the left and right sides of the screen.
3. **Scoring Points**:
   - A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball and it passes their paddle.
   - The game is played to 11 points, and the first player to reach this score wins.
4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The game continues until one player scores 11 points.
   - The winner is the first player to reach the 11-point mark.

## Game Variations

### Single-Player Mode
- One player can play against a computer-controlled opponent by selecting the single-player option (if available) on the game setup menu.

### Two-Player Mode
- Two players compete against each other using the two paddle controllers.

### Difficulty Settings
- Adjust the difficulty settings to make the game more challenging by increasing the ball speed or changing the ball angle dynamics.

## Game Strategies

- Positioning: Stay positioned in the center of your paddle's range to react quickly to the ball.
- Anticipation: Anticipate your opponent's moves and angle your returns strategically.
- Ball Control: Use the paddle's edge to change the angle of the ball and make it more challenging for your opponent to return it.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Display**: Ensure the console is properly connected to the TV and that the TV is on the correct input channel.
- **Poor Controls**: Make sure the paddle controllers are securely plugged in. If the controls are unresponsive, try cleaning the connectors.

## Conclusion

Pong is a timeless and simple yet engaging game that offers a fun experience for both beginners and seasoned gamers. Enjoy playing and competing with friends and family!

End of Atari Pong Game Manual","PONG(R)
-------

Pong(R) is played much like tennis.  Using a Controller, each player
rallys the ball by moving the paddles on the playfield.

Paddles move only vertically on the playfield.  When one player
controls more than one paddle, all the paddles move together in unison. 
If there are two players on one team, the second player's paddle will
be striped.  Each team's paddles are color coordinated with the scores
at the top of the playfield.  The right hand score refers to the right
Controller player or team; the left number shows the left Controller
player or team score.

A player or team scores one point when the opponent hits the ball out
of bounds or misses a hit.  The first player or team to score 21 points
wins the game.

The last player or team to score always serves the ball.  Serve by
pressing the red Controller button after waiting at least one second
after the point is made.  If there are two players on one team, either
player can serve.  In Robot Pong, the computer always serves the ball
to the player...who lost the point.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: In two-player games, plug your standard paddle Controllers into
the left side of the Console.  Each player will have a solid paddle on
the playfield.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Enjoy playing ""Private Eye"" and test your detective skills to solve the mysteries of the city!","Private Eye

""Sacre bleu! I am the great French private eye Pierre Touche and I need
your help. I've been summoned to capture the ringleader, Henri Le Fiend,
and turn him over to the police. But wait -- we first must find evidence
against him and the stolen property. There are five cases pending, each
with its own statute of limitation. A case is closed when Le Fiend is
apprehended and booked. So hurry! Study the files below, grab your
trenchcoat and meet me at Precinct 2600 -- I'll be waiting for you.""


Sleuth wanted! Help Private Eye Touche navigate the city streets, parks,
secret passages, dead-ends and one-ways in search of Henri Le Fiend and
his gang. Evidence and stolen goods are scattered about -- you'll need
to find these, too. Let the map and your memory be your guide. And let
nothing go unnoticed.


ACTIVISION (R)


THE ""LE FIEND"" FILE.


CASE 1: ""Safecracker Suite""

On Thursday, Sept. 7, at approximately 1:30 p.m., bankteller Betty Jeepers
activated the silent alarm near her foot. The man standing at her window
had just handed her a note demanding $10,000 in one bag. The note also
described the loaded gun in his pocket. Jeepers described him as diminutive
but suave and said he bowed slightly as he left, saying, ""Merci beaucoup.""
Quickly, Touche looked to the sky and said, ""It's him.""

PROSECUTION REQUIREMENTS:   Find the gun and verify it at the gunstore.
                            Find the money and return it too the bank.
                            Find Le Fiend and book him at Police Headquarters.
  STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS:   3 minutes
                  LOCALE:   Uptown, 32 blocks


CASE 2: ""Closed on Mondays""

""I thought they were the electricians,"" answered Nimrod Nerdon. Touche had
asked the nervous security guard why he let two men enter the museum on an
off day and then allowed them to shut off the lights. When they came back
on, the men were gone. So was a priceless Ming vase. Nimrod could only
remember that the button was missing on one of the perpetrator's cuffs.
""Oh... and it was a French cuff,"" he added. Touche clenched his teeth.

PROSECUTION REQUIREMENTS:   Find the button and verify it at the tailor shop.
                            Find the vase and return it to the museum.
                            Find Le Fiend and book him at Police Headquarters.
  STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS:   2 minutes
                  LOCALE:   Upper midtown, 32 blocks


CASE 3: ""Dealing in Diamonds""

Mrs. Lotta Moorcash was beside herself. ""But he was such a gentleman!"" A
man claiming to be her new hair stylist had given Mrs. Moorcash a new
hairdo. By the time he'd combed out the last curl, she was oblivious to
the four carat diamond necklace that was suddenly absent from her neck.
""You must find him!"", she said. ""It's the best style I've ever had -- a
French twist!"" Touche's daiquiri glass shattered in his fist.

PROSECUTION REQUIREMENTS:   Find the comb and verify it at the barbershop.
                            Find the necklace and return it to the gemstore.
                            Find Le Fiend and book him at Police Headquarters.
  STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS:   4 minutes
                  LOCALE:   Midtown, 64 blocks


CASE 4: ""Rare Stamp Roulette""

It was the first time Mr. Rich N. Boring had his name in the papers. It was
in recognition of his upcoming donation of a valuable rare stamp to the
Auxiliary Association of Associated Auxiliaries. Unfortunately, his name
was followed by his address. By morning the stamp was gone. From the looks
of the footprints on Boring's newly varnished floor, Touche deduced that
the thief's sole adhered and came loose. The stamp was described as an 1872
commemorative. ""Commemorating what?"" asked Touche. ""The French Revolution.""
Touche raised his collar and left immediately.

PROSECUTION REQUIREMENTS:   Find the shoe sole and verify it at the shoe store.
                            Find the stamp and return it to the stampstore.
                            Find Le Fiend and book him at Police Headquarters.
  STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS:   10 minutes
                  LOCALE:   Downtown, 120 blocks


CASE 5: ""The Big Sweep""

Touche would take a new approach. Rather than gather the evidence case by
case and prosecute Le Fiend four times, he decided to take everything on
at once. The whole city, the entire gang, all the cases and, of course,
Le Fiend. He rose early that day and took a deep, invigorating breath.
""Room service,"" he said into the phone, ""please send up breakfast. What
is today's special?"" The voice on the other end replied, ""French toast.""

PROSECUTION REQUIREMENTS:   All of the stolen goods and evidence in cases
                            1-4 must be found and returned for verification
                            at their place of origin. Le Fiend may then be
                            rounded up and booked at Police Headquarters
                            once -- and for all.
  STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS:   20 minutes
                  LOCALE:   Entire city, 248 blocks


                         BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
                           923-97 OZONE AVENUE
                             NEW YORK, N. Y.
                          CABLE DS: 816.428.822


TO START
Press the game select switch to choose desired case. The case number appears
above the score and its corresponding stolen item appears in the upper right
corner. Then press the reset switch. The statute of limitations begins
counting down as soon as you move the Joystick.


TOUCHE'S AUTO
Upon Touche's arrival, a federal attache will present him with a specially
equipped 1935 Model A. Its unique feature is the ability to jump as high as
two stories. Additionally, it can make 90 degree turns and has a cruise
control.


USE OF THE CONTROLLER
Use the left Joystick. To accelerate left or right... move the Joystick
left or right. To drive into an alley or park lane... push Joystick up.


DIFFICULTY SWITCHES
The left Difficulty switch is your car's cruise control; A maintains a
fast speed, B maintains a slow speed. The right Difficulty switch controls
the car's jumps. By setting it to A, the height of the jump is controlled
by the length of time the red button is held down. Setting it to B causes
the car to jump to its maximum height with a single press of the button.


""Oh... My apologies for the sketchy map on the other side. In any case,
it's our single irreplaceable guide to the city. It came from the waning
memory of a late Le Fiend cohort. Before he passed on, he said something
about secret passages, dead-ends and one-ways, lots of them. Too many for
him to remember. He marked a few of them, but you'll have to map out the
rest.

{Map is a bit too complicated for ASCII}


                             POLICE PROCEDURE

Warrant Requirements -- Reasonable cause must be established before Le Fiend
can be booked with the police. ""Reasonable cause"" consists of finding the
evidence, verifying it at its place of origin, recovering the stolen property
and returning it to its owner. The evidence and stolen item may be found in
any order, but you may only carry and return one item at a time. Proceed with
caution: After the first item has been returned, thugs lurch out from behind
steps and bushes to throw daggers. Jump to avoid them. If you're hit, the
thugs will repossess anything you are carrying.

Questionable Characters -- Throughout the case, questionable characters will
peek out of windows. Any one of them may be harboring the item you are
looking for. Jump up and see! Even if their empty-handed, you'll still get
merit points each time you nab one of them. Finally, if you recover an item
while you are carrying another item, the questionable character will make a
switch and you will continue with the new item.

The City Beat -- Get to know the locations of detours and roadblocks. Detours
are striped; roadblocks are solid yellow. You will also encounter secret
passages, one-ways and dead-ends. Secret passages are short-cuts whereby you
enter an alley on one street, and may emerge on a different block, often in
a different part of the city! Get to know these short-cuts and map them out.
Many offer round-trip passage, but some are one-way only or dead-ends.


POLICE MERIT SYSTEM

Special agents will begin with 1000 merit points -- just for taking on the
case!

The following system of merits and demerits applies:

DEMERITS

   Minus 1   Whenever auto is on a pot hole.
 Minus 100   If Touche or his car is hit by a brick.
 Minus 200   If hit by a flowerpot.
 Minus 300   If hit by a rat.
 Minus 400   If hit by a bird.
Minus 1000   If hit by a dagger.

MERITS

   Plus 100  For each questionable character nabbed.
  Plus 5000  For each questionable character nabbed with evidence (gun,
             button, comb, shoe sole).
Plus 15,000  For each questionable character nabbed with stolen item (money,
             vase, necklace, stamp).
Plus 10,000  Whenever evidence is verified.
Plus 20,000  Whenever a stolen item is returned.
Plus 25,000  For nabbing Henri Le Fiend.
Plus 25,000  For booking Le Fiend at Police Headquarters and, thus, closing
             the case.

LETTER FROM THE COMMISSIONER

Tips from Bob Whitehead, designer of Private Eye (TM). Bob is not only an
award-winning, senior designer at Activision, he's also one of its founders!
He lives in California with his wife Karron and their four children, and is
an avid fan of sports, particularly baseball.

""Well sleuths... I hope you're not looking for any dead giveaways. You've
got to figure this one out for yourselves. But here are some clues:

""Try to figure out the best direction to head in when you begin each case.
Some cases are easier when you start out to the left, and some are easier
when you start out to the right. Also, certain cases ""prefer"" you to pick
up the evidence first, while others are more easily solved when the stolen
item is found first. So discover and jot down the ""initial direction"" and
""order of search"" for each case.

""Touche! to those of you who will brave Case 5. I feel obligated to say
that, although it is the sum of Cases 1-4, some of the secret passages will
be changed. But don't let that discourage you. Just adjust your map a bit.

""When you get back to the precinct with Le Fiend, please send a report --
it'll be fun to compare notes. Good luck and God bless.""

(Note: Refer to the official Atari documentation for specific console compatibility and further detailed instructions. This manual serves as a guideline for playing and does not include detailed technical support for hardware issues.)","Q*bert(TM)

The Supreme Moser!

  Q+bert is an energetic IittIe guy, with a big nose, who hops up and down cubicle pyramids 
in a magical world.

 When Q*bert hops on a cube, its top changes color, so Q*bert invented a little game: he 
loves to go from pyramid to pyramid, changing all the cube tops in each pyramid to another 
color.

 But nothing comes easily, even in Q'bert's world. Q*bert's enemies, Sam and Coily, do their
best to thwart Q*bert in his colorful game. Sometimes they make Q*bert mad enough to say, 
""!#?""

 It takes quick thinking and a quick wrist to help Q*bert change all of the cube tops to the
desired color When you succeed, YOU are the Supreme Noser!

Getting Started

1. With your television turned on, insert the Q*bert cartridge into your Atari 2600 (or 
7800(TM)) as explained in your Owner's Manual, and turn on your console. First a pyramid of 
cubes will appear and then Q*bert, standing on top of the pyramid.

2. Plug a joystick into the left joystick port.

3. If you are using an Atari 2600, select color using the TV switch.

4. Set the Left Difficulty switch to either the B (novice) or A (expert) position.

5. Press [Reset] or thejoystick fire button to start the game.

Making Q*bert Hop

 Hold the joystick so that the four corners make a baseball diamond, with the fire button at
the top.

 Move thejoystick in the four diagonal directions to hop diagonally from cube to cube all 
around the pyramid.

 Be careful not to hop off the sides of the Pyramid or the bottom row of cubes. If you do, 
you'll lose poor Q*bert.

 Jump onto one of the flying disks if you're ever in trouble. It will carry you to the 
safety of the highest cube. Be careful to hop from the correct exit cube, or you'll fall off
the pyramid.

Playing the Game

 With Q*bert, your goal is to score as many points as possible by changing the color of 
every cube in the pyramid into the pyramid's ""destination"" color. To do so, you must hop 
onto each cube in the pyramid one at a time, while avoiding the nasty creatures that lurk 
there. These creatures want nothing more than to stop your progress.

 You'll start the game with four Q*berts. Whenever you reset the game, Q*bert #1 appears on 
the highest cube. The remaining three backup Q*berts await their turn under the scorekeeper 
at the top of the screen. You'll lose a Q*bert if you accidentally jump off the pyramid into
space or if you run into trouble with certain nasty creatures. If you fall off the pyramid, 
your next Q*bert will appear on the highest cube. If Q*bert is squashed by a red or purple 
ball, or by Coily the snake, your next Q*bert continues playing where the last one was.

 After you transform the entire pyramid, the round is over. As long as you have at least one
remaining Q*bert, you'll earn points and advance to the next round. There you'll find a new 
pyramid, a new destination color, and a new pack of revitalized creatures.

 The game has five game levels, each having four rounds. As you proceed through each round, 
both Q*bert and the creatures speed up, and the path you must follow to reach the 
destination color becomes more and more difficult. The backup Q*berts and scoreboard display
the destination color for each pyramid.

 The game is over when you run out of Q*berts. If you reset the game, you'll begin at level 
1, round 1.

 If you complete all five game levels, the game repeats level 5, beginning with round 1.

Nasty Creature Strategies

Nasty Creature		Strategy

Red Ball		When the ball starts rolling, get out of its path or it will squash
			you!

Purple Ball		Get out of its path. When it reaches the bottom of the pyramid. it
			will hatch Coily the snake!

Coily			Stay away from Coily, or you'll get squashed! Lure him off the
			pyramid by hopping onto one of the flying disks. Just before Coily 
			reaches the exit cube, jump onto the disk. Coily  will follow and 
			fall into space.

Sam			Watch out for Sam. He poses no direct threat to Q*bert, but this
			crafty little fellow changes the cubes back to their original
			colors, forcing you to retrace your tracks. You can stop this 
			prankster by running into him. if you do, you'll earn bonus points.

Green Ball		The green ball can't hurt you. When you touch it, all the creatures 
			except for Q*bert will freeze for a few seconds. You can keep on 
			hopping while they're frozen, and you'll win bonus points. You can 
			even hop through Coily and the red balls.

The game ends when you run out of lives or fuel. Your final score will be displayed, and you can restart the game by pressing the ""Reset"" button.

## Tips and Strategies

- **Stay Centered**: Try to navigate closer to the center of the river for easier maneuvering.
- **Fuel Conservation**: Maintain a balance between aggressive gameplay and fuel conservation.
- **Practice**: The more you play, the better you'll become at anticipating and reacting to enemy patterns and obstacles.

## Conclusion

River Raid is a game that combines quick reflexes with strategic fuel management. We hope this manual helps you on your mission. Prepare for high-flying action and enjoy your journey through the river!

                    PLAN OF OPERATION

----------------------------RIVER RAID BASICS----------------------------------
Your mission is to score as many points possible by destroying enemy tankers,
helicopters, fuel depots, jets and bridges before your jet crashes or runs out
of fuel.  Here's how to begin:

1.  Hook up your video game system.  Follow Manufacturer's instructions.

2.  With power OFF, plug in game cartridge.

3.  Turn power on.  If no picture appears, check connections of your game 
    system to TV, then repeat steps 1-3.

4.  Plug in Joystick Controller/s.  Solo player uses left Joystick.

5.  Set both difficulty switches to b to begin.

6.  Select game with the game select switch.
         Game 1:  One player
         Game 2:  Two players taking turns

7.  Use of the Joystick Controller.  Hold Joystick Controller with the red
    button in the upper left position.  Fire missiles by depressing red button.
    Hold the red button down for continuous fire.  Move the Joystick to the 
    left to bank left.  Move the Joystick to the right to bank right.  Move 
    Joystick forward to accelerate your jet.  Pull Joystick back to slow your
    jet.

8.  To begin or start a new game.  Press game reset.  This will bring your jet
    up to the starter mark.  Then press the red button or move the Joystick to
    start the action.

9.  Difficulty Switches.  With difficulty switches in the a position, missiles
    streak straight ahead.  With switches in the b position, you can control
    the direction of your missiles after they have been fired by ""steering""
    them with your Joystick Controller.

[Note to owners of Sears TeleGames Video Arcade:  Difficuly is called skill,
and a is expert, b is novice.]

10. Reinforcements.  You begin each game with a squadron of three jets in
    reserve.  For each 10,000 points you score, you're given an additional jet.
    You can only have nine reserve jets on the screen at one time.


11. Fuel.  You have a limited amount of fuel.  When you begin to run low, fly
    over a fuel depot to refuel (See ""Fuel Gauge"" under ""Special Features"").

12. Scoring.  Each time you destroy an enemy object, you score points.  The
    point values for each object are listed below:

                     River Raid Point System

-----------------------SPECIAL FEATURES OF RIVER RAID--------------------------
                                BY ACTIVISION

The River of No Return.  The river is divided into sections with a bridge at 
the end of each section.  Notice that the river is always changing.  You will
encounter islands, narrow channels, bays, and lots of enemy ships and aircraft
moving to block your path.  Also, the farther down the river you fly, the 
fewer fuel depots you'll find.  In some areas, fuel is quite scarce, so you'll
really have to move if you want to survive.

Fuel Gauge.  Always keep an eye on your fuel gauge.  Fuel is used up at a 
constant rate, regardless of speed.  When your fuel drops below 1/4 full, a
warning siren sounds to alert you--it's time to refuel!  The slower you fly 
over a depot, the more fuel you receive.  A bell will sound while you are
refueling.  The sound changes to a higher pitch when your fuel tank is full.

Losing a Jet.  You lose a jet when it collides with the river bank or one of
the enemy objects (except fuel depots), or when you run out of fuel.  If you
have a reserve jet left, you restart play at the same section of the river 
where you crashed.  However, if you've managed to destroy the bridge at the end
of that section, then you get to restart play at the beginning of the next 
section.

-----------------------GETTING THE FEEL OF RIVER RAID--------------------------
                                BY ACTIVISION

To learn to fly successful missions, you'll need the sensitivity, touch and
sharpshooting skills of a precision jet pilot.  But that takes time and
practice.

At first, try jetting down the river at slow speed.  Practice banking your
plane, sharpening your aim, and dodging the enemy.  To win in this game, you'll
have to be just as good at dodging as you are at destroying enemy bridges and
aircraft.

Then accelerate your jet with bursts of speed to see how it reacts to the
controls.  Since you'll be making split-second decisions, you'll need to know
exactly how you and your plane will act in a pressure situation.

                        HOW TO BECOME A RIVER RAIDER
                Tips from Carol Shaw, designer of River Raid

     Carol Shaw is one of Activision's newest game designers, but isn't
     a newcomer to video game design.  She's also a scholar in the field
     of Computer Science.

""The River of No Return holds many special challenges and dangers for would-be
River Raiders.  You'll not only have to know your assault jet, but you'll need
to have a good idea of your basic fight plan before you start.

""By knowing the river, pinpointing areas with the highest concentration of
enemy, and the most fuel depots, you'll have a much better chance of surviving.
Since the river is in sections, try jotting down notes for each important 
section as flight aids.

""Fuel is also a critical factor.  When you're far up the river, fuel is scarce.
So, concentrate on flying to the next fuel depot, and don't try to destroy 
every object.

""When you become really skilled, you'll find you can actually blow up a fuel
depot right in the middle of refueling.  That way, you can gain the points and
some fuel at the same time.

""Finally, remember that your main targets are the bridges.  They're worth the
most points.  And, please, drop me a note and let me know how you're doing.  
I'd really like to hear from you!""

Seaquest,"# Seaquest Game Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to Seaquest, an underwater adventure where you take the role of a daring submarine captain. Navigate treacherous waters filled with sea creatures and dangers as you embark on a mission to rescue stranded divers and bring them safely to the surface.

## Contents

1. Game Overview
2. Game Controls
3. Scoring
4. Game Strategy
5. Ending the Game

## Game Overview

In Seaquest, you control a submarine navigating through the ocean depths. Your primary objective is to rescue stranded divers while avoiding or combating hostile sea life and ensuring your submarine's oxygen supply does not deplete. The game becomes progressively more challenging as you advance through different levels.

## Game Controls

 - **Joystick**: 
   - Move Left: Move the submarine left.
   - Move Right: Move the submarine right.
   - Move Up: Move the submarine up.
   - Move Down: Move the submarine down.
 - **Fire Button**: Use this button to shoot torpedoes at enemy sea creatures.

## Scoring

- **Rescue Divers**: Earn points for each diver you successfully rescue and bring to the surface.
- **Destroy Enemies**: Gain points for each enemy sea creature you destroy.
- **Bonus Points**: Additional points are awarded for completing levels quickly and for extra divers at the end of each level.

## Game Strategy

1. **Rescue Divers Efficiently**: Focus on quickly locating and rescuing divers to maximize your score.
2. **Manage Oxygen**: Keep an eye on your oxygen meter. When it runs low, bring your submarine to the surface to replenish.
3. **Combat Enemies Wisely**: Use your torpedoes strategically to clear paths through hostile waters and protect rescued divers.
4. **Level Progression**: As you advance, enemies become more aggressive and numerous. Plan your movements and attacks carefully to navigate higher levels successfully.

## Ending the Game

The game ends when you run out of lives. Each player starts with three lives, and losing all of them concludes the game. Lives are lost when your submarine is destroyed by enemies or when your oxygen runs out.

Good luck, captain! Dive deep, navigate carefully, and rescue those divers to achieve a high score in Seaquest!","Activision
SEAQUEST(TM)

SEQUEST(TM) BASICS

Your divers have retrieved the buried treasure, and now you must come to their
rescue.  The object of Seaquest is to retrieve as many treasure-divers as you
can, while dodging and blasting enemy subs and killer sharks.  All before your
oxygen runs out!

1. Hook up your video game system.  Follow manufacturer's instructions.

2. With power OFF, plug in game cartridge.

3. Turn power ON.  If no picture appears, check connection of your game system
to TV, then repeat steps 1-3.

4. Plug in Joystick Controller/s (solo player uses left Joystick)

5. Set both difficulty switches to b to begin.  Switches in this position will
cause fast continuous fire from your submarine.  Set switches in a position
for slower continuous fire.

6. Select game with game select switch:

          Game 1                  Game 2
          One player              Two players taking turns

7. To start, press game reset.  This will position your sub on the waves, place
three reserver subs on the horizon and fill your oxygen tank.  The action
begins as soon as you submerge.

8. The Joystick Controller is held with the red button in the upper left
position.  Press the red button to fire torpedoes, hold it down for continuous 
fire.  Pull the Joystick back and you'll submerge; push it forward and you will
ascend.  Move the Joystick left or right to face your sub to the left or to
the right.  Push the Joystick to the left or right to move your sub in that
direction.

9. Rescue divers by cruising into them with your sub.  As soon as you have
retrieved your _sixth_ diver, you'll hear a quick beep.  Now surface and listen
to six gold ingots, worth valuable points, plunk onto your deck (see ""Scoring"").

10. Scoring.  When the game begins, every killer shark and enemy sub is worth
20 points.  Every time you surface with six divers, the value of enemy subs
and killer sharks increases by 10, up to a maximum of 90 points each.  Rescued
divers start at 50 points each.  Then, their point value increases by 50, every
time you surface, up to a maximum of 1000 points each.  Also, you'll be 
further rewarded with bonus points for all the oxygen you have remaining the
moment you surface.  The more oxygen you have left, the more bonus points
you're given.

Note to owners of Sears Tele-Games(R) Video Arcade(TM): Difficulty is called
skill, and a is expert, b is novice.

SPECIAL FEATURES OF SEAQUEST(TM) BY ACTIVISION(R)

Your Oxygen Gauge is at the bottom of the screen.  Whenever your sub is
underwater you'll be using up oxygen at a constant rate.  When the oxygen
tank is almost empty, a continuous beep alarm will sound and the alarm light
will flash.  you have _8_ seconds to surface for air!  If you don't surface in
time, your sub will blow up and you'll lose one diver.  Each time you're forced
to surface, with less than six divers, you lose one diver.  And, if you
surface with no divers on board, you'll lose your sub.

Killer Sharks and Enemy Subs are deadly.  If your sub collides with anything
except your own divers, your sub will explode.  And, the longer you're out
in the ocean, the rougher the seas become.  So after each round, take a 
breath - enemy subs and sharks will increase in speed.

The Enemy Patrol Sub will appear on the surface when you've rescued your second
group of six divers.  Avoid it.  If you collide, your sub will explode, and
you'll lose one diver.  While you are refilling your oxygen tank, the Patrol
Sub will move in on you.  Your sub cannot move away until its oxygen tank is
full.  So when you surface, do so as far from the Patrol Sub as possible!

You Have Reinforcement Submarines.  You start the game with four subs in your
fleet--one ready at sea-level and three waiting on the horizon.  Each time you
increase your score by 10,000 points, an extra sub will be delivered to your
base.  You can only have six reserve subs on the screen at one time.

GETTING THE FEEL OF SEAQUEST(TM) BY ACTIVISION(R)

Mastering the movement of your submarine will be your first and most important
duty.  Be careful not to oversteer!  ""Steady as she goes"" is a good rule for
beginners.  Also, practice ""Silent Running"" -- navigating your sub around
sharks and enemy subs without firing.  It takes skill to learn this technique,
but remember: your real mission is to rescue divers--they're worth the most
points!

JOIN THE ACTIVISION ""SUB CLUB""

Once your sea legs are steady, you can propel yourself into the ""Sub Club.""
Reach a score of 50,000 points (or more) and you'll be eligible to join this
prestigious organization.  Just send us a picture of your TV screen with your
name and address and we'll present you with an official ""Sub Club"" emblem.

HOW TO JOIN THE SEQUEST(TM) ""SUB CLUB""

Tips from Steve Cartwright, designer of Seaquest(TM).

Steve Cartwright is a Senior Designer of Activision(R).  Before creating
Seaquest(TM), Steve designed Barnstorming(TM) and MegaMania(TM) for Activision.

""As you'll quickly discover, you can't join the Sub Club overnight.  It takes
confidence, sharp aim, and lots of practice.  Also, here are a couple of
important pointers that should help.

""As soon as you've picked up your sixth diver, start watching out for the
Patrol Sub.  It's important to surface in the right spot, especially since
the Patrol Sub sails faster as the game progresses.

""And, every time you surface, you increase the game's level of difficulty.
So, keep your surfacing to a minimum, with one exception: when you've got five
divers aboard, and your oxygen's running low--surface to refill your oxygen
supply.  You'll lose one diver, but you can easily pick up two or more to
resurface and gain a lot of extra bonus points.

""Practice 'Silent Running'.  It's the best technique I know of to really learn
underwater navigation.

""And, next time you return to shore, drop me a note.  I'd love to hear your tall
tales from the high seas.""

Skiing,"# Atari Skiing Game Manual

## Objective
The goal of Skiing is to navigate your skier down the slope, avoiding obstacles and passing through gates to accumulate points and achieve the fastest time possible.

## Game Controls

- **Joystick:** Move the skier left and right. The further you push the joystick, the sharper the turn.
- **Button:** No specific button functionality is required for basic play in Skiing.

## Game Modes
There are multiple game modes available which can be selected at the start:

1. **Downhill (G1, G2):** In this mode, the objective is to reach the bottom of the slope as fast as possible. Points are awarded based on the time it takes to complete the run.
2. **Slalom (G3, G4):** In this mode, you must navigate through a series of gates. Points are awarded for successfully passing through each gate and are deducted for missing gates.

**G1 and G3:** Basic single-player modes.
**G2 and G4:** Two-player alternating modes.

## Starting a Game

1. Power on the Atari console.
2. Insert the Skiing game cartridge.
3. Use the Select button to choose your desired game mode (G1, G2, G3, G4).
4. Press the Reset button to start the game.

## Scoring

- **Downhill:** Your score is based on how quickly you reach the bottom. Faster times result in higher scores.
- **Slalom:** Points are awarded for each gate navigated successfully. Points are lost for each missed gate.

## Tips for Success

- Practice controlling the skier with the joystick to get a feel for the responsiveness.
- In slalom mode, focus on passing through gates smoothly to avoid losing points.
- For downhill mode, aim for the fastest line down the slope while dodging obstacles to avoid crashes, which will slow you down.

## Game Variations

- **Skill Levels:** Different skill levels can be chosen through the difficulty switches on the console, affecting the speed and difficulty of the game.

                            INSTRUCTIONS

Now you can ski all year long without worrying about tight boots, cold hands,
long lift lines--or whether it snows!  Skiing by ACTIVISION challenges you with
a wide variety of slalom and downhill runs, designed for everyone from amateur
to pro.  Even if you've never been on a pair of skiis, you can be a champion
skier with Skiing by AACTIVISION.  Read these instructions to find out how to
make record-breaking runs without getting wrapped around a tree or crashing 
into a gate.

-------------------------------SKIING BASICS-----------------------------------
1.  Hook up your video game system.  Follow manufacturer's instructions.

2.  With power OFF, plug in game cartridge.

3.  Turn power ON.  If no picture appears, check connection of your game system
    to TV, then try steps 1-3 again.

4.  Plug in left Joystick Controller (it's the only one you'll need).  Hold it
    with the button at upper left.

5.  Set both difficulty switches to b (down) to begin.

6.  Select run with game select switch:

          Slalom Runs
          Game 1:  20 gates, Novice run
          Game 2:  40 gates, Intermediate run
          Game 3:  30 gates, Expert run
          Game 4:  50 gates, Olympic run
          Game 5:  30 gates, a new Expert run every time you select Game 5

          Downhill Runs
          Game 6:  200 meters, Novice hill
          Game 7:  300 meters, Intermediate hill
          Game 8:  500 meters, Expert hill
          Game 9:  900 meters, Olympic hill
          Game 10: A new 900-meter Olympic hill every time you select Game 10

    NOTE:  The hills and courses for Games 1-4 and 6-9 are permanently set.
    Each tree, gate and mogul is in the same place every time you ski these 
    runs.  Whenever you select Game 5 or 10, however, you get a new course
    each time.  The course will remain the same for as many runs as you want
    to take until you select another game or turn the power off.  When you
    return to Game 5 or 10 again, you'll face a new run and a new challenge.

7.  Press game reset to place skier at the top of the hill.  The timer will
    reset to 0.

8.  To start skier, move Joystick to any position (or just tap it).

9.  Your Joystick controls the position of your skis.  Push it to the left and
    your ski tips will move to the left;  push it to the right and your ski
    tips will move to the right.  The longer you hold the Joystick in either
    direction, the farther your skiis will go, until they reach horizontal
    (you can't ski uphill!).  Your skier will go in the direction your skis are
    pointed and will reach maximum downhill speed when the skis are pointed
    directly downhill.  (See diagram of ski positions.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



-----------------------SPECIAL FEATURES OF SLALOM RACING-----------------------
Object:    To run through all gates (between the poles) in the fastes time.

Scoring:   Elapsed time on timer.  You are penalized five seconds for each gate
           you miss.  At the end of each run, the number of gates you missed 
           and your total time (including penalties, if any) are shown on the
           screen.

If you hit a gate or a tree, do not lose heart:  You skier will jump back up 
and keep going.  But you do lose time, so be careful!

The red button on your Joystick is not used in slalom racing, but can be used
instead of the game reset switch to reset your skier at the top of the course.
Don't push it unless you want to start over.

To make a run tougher, push your right difficulty switch up to a.  Now trees
will appear on the slalom course in front of the gates (not just off to the
side), so you'll really have to be quick to dodge them and still make all the
gates.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



----------------------SPECIAL FEATURES OF DOWNHILL RACING----------------------
Object:    To reach the bottom of the hill in the fastes time.

Scoring:   Elapsed time at the end of the run.  During the run, the number of
           meters remaining is shown above the elapsed time.

Penalties: None.  But if you hit a tree or fall on a mogul (see below), you'll
           lose time.

The red button on your Joystick is only used when your right difficulty switch
is up or at a.  Then you must push the button to make your skier jump any 
moguls in your path (they are the grey patches in the snow).  The timing of 
your jumps is critical;  if you're off, your skier will hit the mogul and fall
on his face.  If trying to dodge trees and jump moguls gets a bit too tricky,
just push your right difficulty switch down to b and your skier will jump each
mogul automatically.  

Note:  You must push the game reset to start at the top of the hill on downhill
runs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



                       ABOUT THE LEFT DIFFICULTY SWITCH
 
With the left difficulty switch in the down or b position, the ski run passes
by vertically but does not change horizontally, so your skier cannot ski off
the course.  When he reaches the edge, he stops moving horizontally.

With the left difficulty switch in the up or a position, you can direct your 
skier off the trail and through the woods--even ski all the way around the
mountain, if you wish.  We suggest you try this option on downhill runs only
(Games 6-10), as an interesting and creative variation on the normal ski run.

[Note to owners of Sears Tele-Game:  On your Sears system, difficulty switches
are called skill left (or right) player and a (or up) is expert and b (or down)
is novice.]




-----------------------------GETTING THE FEEL OF-------------------------------
                            SKIING BY ACTIVISION

Once you know the basics of Skiing, we suggest you get the feel of your
controls by skiing on the slow slopes first (Games 1, 2 and 6).  Start with
both difficulty switches at b (or down) while you're learning.  Move your 
Joystick right and left gradually to move slowly across and down the hill,
through the trees and gates.  See how your skis respond to your Joystick
movements and how changing ski positions changes your skier's direction and
speed.  You will go fastest when your skis are pointed straight downhill and
you'll slow down when you are moving at an angle.  You can stop your skier in
mid-hill by moving your skis all the way horizontal.

When you're ready for more advanced challenges, try the faster runs.  You'll
get faster times, but watch out!  The slope is steeper and the gates, trees
and moguls come flying at you.  And when you're really a hot shot, push your
right difficulty switch up to a to push your skills to the limit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



                       HOW TO BECOME AND EXPERT AT SKIING
                                BY ACTIVISION
                  Tips from Bob Whitehead, designer of Skiing

     Bob Whitehead, well known for his fast-action, excitement-packed 
     video games, also designed Boxing by ACTIVISION.

""The keys to success in Skiing by ACTIVISION, just as in real skiing, are 
learning to control the tips of your skis and anticipating and avoiding
trouble.

""Keep your skis pointed as straight down the hill as possible.  The less you
traverse across the slope, the faster you'll make it to the bottom.

""Pick your line through the trees and gates by constantly looking ahead of your
position toward the bottom of the screen.  When you see the next set of trees
and/or gates, point your skis to miss the trees or pass through the gates.  Of
course, the more you ski any particular hill, the more familiar with it you
will become.  To get the fastest times, you must memorize the run and ski the
shortest possible route down the hill or through the gates.

""When you want to maneuver, I suggest you tap your Joystick lightly to the
right or left to move your skis or change direction, rather than push heavily
on the stick.  There are 8 different positions for your skis (see my diagram
below) and 15 different directions you can go (downhill plus two possible
angles for each left or right ski position).

""We're organizing an Activision Ski Team.  To qualify, you must run slalom
course 3 (Game 3) in under 28.2 seconds.  If you break that time, send us a
picture of the screen and we will enroll you as a member.  And if you break
28 seconds, consider yourself Olympic caliber.

""Of course, not everyone wants to ski down a hill in record time.  Some of you
may just like to ski back and forth and down the hill at your own pace.  Go
ahead, if you wish.

""I really had a great time working on Skiing by ACTIVISION.  I hope you enjoy
playing it as much as I enjoyed designing it.  Have fun and God bless!""

[Bob Whitehead]

## 1. Getting Started

### Game Installation
Insert the Space Invaders cartridge into your Atari console and power it on. The game will start automatically.

### Main Menu
After powering on your console, you will see the Space Invaders title screen. Press the ""Start"" button to begin playing.

## 2. How to Play

### Objective
The main objective of Space Invaders is to protect the Earth by defeating all incoming waves of aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen. You control a laser cannon that can move horizontally along the bottom of the screen.

### Aliens
Aliens move horizontally across the screen and gradually descend towards the Earth. Each wave increases in speed and difficulty. You must shoot the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen.

### Barriers
There are barriers positioned above your laser cannon. These barriers provide temporary shelter from enemy fire and can be used to strategically defend yourself. However, barriers can be destroyed by both alien and your own shots.

### UFO
Occasionally, a UFO will appear at the top of the screen. Shooting the UFO can give you bonus points.

## 3. Scoring

- Alien (bottom row): 10 points
- Alien (middle rows): 20 points
- Alien (top row): 30 points
- UFO: 100-300 points (varies randomly)

## 4. Game Controls

- **Joystick**: Move your laser cannon left and right.
- **Fire button**: Shoot your laser cannon.

## 5. Tips and Strategies

1. **Aim Carefully**: Conserve your shots and aim carefully as rapid firing can destroy your own barriers.
2. **Use Barriers Wisely**: Use the barriers for protection but be aware that they will not last indefinitely.
3. **Focus on One Side**: Try to clear out one side of the alien formation first to limit their movement.
4. **Shoot the UFO**: Take every opportunity to shoot the UFO for extra points.
5. **Stay Calm**: As the game progresses, aliens will move faster. Stay calm and strategically target the most immediate threats.

Enjoy defending the Earth from the alien invasion in Space Invaders! Good luck, and may the best player win!","1.ENGLISH SECTION                              112 VIDEO GAMES

ATARI
A Warner Communications Company                         CX2632

*SPACE INVADERS is the trademark of Taito America Corp. 1980

Use your Joystick Controllers with this Game Program TM. Be
sure the controllers are firmly  plugged into the LEFT and
RIGHT CONTROLLER jacks at the rear of your Video Computer
System TM. Hold the controller with the red button to your
upper left toward the television screen.

Use the Joystick plugged into the LEFT CONTROLLER jack for
one-player games. See Section 3 of your Video Computer System
Owner's Manual for further details.

NOTE: Always turn the console power switch off when inserting
or removing a Game Program. This will protect the electronic
components and prolong the life of your ATARI (R) Video
Computer System.

GAME OBJECTIVE

Each time you turn on SPACE INVADERS you will be at war with
enemies from space who are threatening the earth. Your
objective is to destroy these invaders by firing your ""laser
cannon."" You must wipe out the invaders either before they
reach the earth (bottom of the screen), or before they hit you
three times with their ""laser bombs.""

Your long-term objective is to score as many points as
possible. Points are scored each time you hit one of the SPACE
INVADERS. They are worth different amounts of points,
depending on their initial position on the screen. (See
SCORING)

If you  destroy all 36 SPACE INVADERS before they reach the
earth, a new set of invaders will appear on the screen. Each
time the invaders are reset on the screen they will start from
a position closer to the earth until they reach the closest
position possible. The SPACE INVADERS can be reset on the
screen indefinitely during a game.

USING THE CONTROLLERS

Move the Joystick to the right or left to manuever your laser
cannon across the bottom of the screen. Do this to avoid being
hit by the laser bombs, which the invaders will continually
drop from the sky, and to aim your own ""laser beams."" Each
time your cannon is hit by one of the laser bombs the game
pauses temporarily, and the number of hits you have remaining
is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

Press the red controller button to fire your laser cannon.
Each time you fire the cannon you may not fire it again until
you hit a target, or until the laser beam disappears off the
top of the screen.

Depress the game select switch to choose the game variation
you wish to play. The game variation number is displayed at
the top, left side of the screen. The number opposite on the
top, right side of the screen represents the number of players
for each game.

TO BEGIN PLAY Console Controls

The SPACE INVADERS move faster on the screen as their numbers
decrease, making them more difficult to hit. The fastest speed
occurs when only one invader remains on the screen.

Since there are 112 game variations to SPACE INVADERS, a quick
look at the Game Matrix in the center of this instruction
booklet is helpful when choosing or locating a game.

NOTE: Holding the game select switch down will cause the game
number to increase continually on the screen. However, to
increase the game number rapidly, depress and hold down both
the game select and game reset switches. As you near the
desired game number, release the game reset switch and bring
up the game number you want using only the game select switch.

Depress the game reset switch to begin a game.

Difficulty switches

The difficulty switches control the size of the laser cannons
on the screen. In the b position, the cannon is smaller, and
therefore easier for the beginning player to use. In the a
position, the cannon is twice as large, and therefore more
susceptible to enemy fire. In a one-player game, use the left
difficulty switch to control the size of the cannon. In two-
player games the left player uses the left difficulty switch,
and the right player uses the right difficulty switch to
control the cannon size.

GENERAL INFORMATION

By now you know that you must hit and eliminate the SPACE
INVADERS before they reach the earth, or, bottom of the
screen. You also know that you must evade their falling laser
bombs in order to save the earth and keep the game going.

Here are some other bits of information which will help you to
play SPACE INVADERS. 

Periodically during a game, the COMMAND ALIEN SHIP will fly
across the top of the screen (sometimes from left to right,
sometimes right to left).

The COMMAND SHIP is worth 200 points* whenever you hit it,
which is considerably more than any other target (see
SCORING). You will be pleased to know that the COMMAND SHIP
does not drop laser bombs or anything else, and is therefore
harmless to you and your laser cannon. The COMMAND SHIP is
simply a bonus if you are able to hit it. Be careful not to
concentrate so much on hitting it that you get hit with an
enemy laser bomb.

There are SHIELDS (screen diagram) positioned on the screen
between your laser cannon and the SPACE INVADERS. At the
outset you are safe behind the SHIELDS. However, as you and
the enemy hit the SHIELDS, they become damaged, allowing laser
beams from your cannon and laser bombs from the enemy to pass
through them. As the SPACE INVADERS get close to the SHIELDS
on their way to the earth, the SHIELDS disappear altogether.

Remember, if the lowest SPACE INVADERS reach the earth (bottom
of the screen), the game ends.

The small lines or bars at the bottom of the screen (see
screen diagram) indicate the farthest points to which you may
move to the right or to the left. Be careful not to get caught
at the edge of these points when hemmed in by enemy fire.

*In games ""C"" and ""D"" the COMMAND SHIP is worth 100 points.
(See ONE-PLAYER/TWO-PLAYER OPTIONS)

GAME VARIATIONS

There are several GAME VARIATIONS programmed into SPACE
INVADERS. Again, check the Game Matrix for a specific
breakdown of the variations for each game number. The
variations are intended to challenge the experienced player,
as well as to provide variety in general.

The variations include:

Moving Shields- the SHIELDS move back and forth on the screen,
as opposed to remaining in a fixed or stationary position.
Using them for protection becomes hazardous.

Zigzagging Laser Bombs- the laser bombs ""zigzag"" back and
forth as they come down the screen. It is difficult to know
exactly where they are going to land, and thus, stay out of
their path.

Fast Laser Bombs- they drop quickly and are much more
difficult to avoid. (When the laser bombs are both zigzagging
AND fast, even the experienced players will have their hands
full.)

Invisible Invaders- the invaders are invisible on the screen
after game play begins. Each time one is hit, the remainder of
the invaders appear momentarily on the screen, and then
disappear until one is hit again.

NOTE: When you're in the mood for a serious challenge, try
Game 16.

ONE-PLAYER/TWO-PLAYER OPTIONS

In addition to the GAME VARIATIONS, there are several ways in
which one or two players may play SPACE INVADERS.

A.   The ""normal"" or basic game for one player. (GAMES 1-16)
     GAME VARIATIONS are optional, but one player always
     competes against the computer.

B.   Two opposing players taking alternate turns. (Games 17-
     32) Left player goes first (starts on left side of
     screen), then the right player takes a turn (starting
     from right side). The screen display changes so that each
     player has his or her own set of invaders. The SHIELDS
     are completely restored for each new turn. The COMMAND
     ALIEN SHIP is worth 200 points. Play ends for each player
     after three enemy hits, or when invaders reach the earth.
     Highest score wins.

C.   Two opposing players competing at the same time. (Games
     33-48) Both players fire away simultaneously and compete
     for a higher score. The COMMAND ALIEN SHIP is worth 100
     points. Whenever you are hit, you opponents is awarded
     200 points. Play ends after three hits are taken between
     the two players, or when the invaders reach the earth.

D.   Two opposing players competing at the same time, taking
     alternate shots. (Games 49-64) If you wait too long, your
     laser cannon is fired automatically and your opponent can
     set up a shot. All other game play characteristics are
     the same is in C above.

E.   Two player partnership game. (Games 65-80) Both players
     control a common laser cannon. Each player can move in
     one direction only. Right player moves the cannon to the
     right, left player moves it to the left. Either play may
     fire. Otherwise, this version is like a one-player
     ""normal"" game (one score display, COMMAND SHIP = 200
     points, etc.)

F.   Two-player partnership game with alternating firing and
     controlling of the cannon. (Games 81-96) The left player
     starts and may move the cannon in either direction. After
     ONE shot by the left player, the right player then has
     control and fires one shot. Both players are striving for
     a common (high) score, as in the E version above.

G.   Two-player partnership game with one player controlling
     cannon movement and the other player firing laser beams.
     (games 97-112) Left player moves the cannon, right player
     fires. Otherwise, this version is the same as the other
     ""partnership"" games.

SCORING

The SPACE INVADERS are worth 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 points in
the first through sixth rows respectively. (See diagram.) The
point value of each target stays the same as it drops lower on
the screen. Each complete set of SPACE INVADERS is worth 630
points.
Although scoring can be infinite, there is only room for four
digits on the display, so that the highest score any player
will ever see on the screen is 9999. This does not represent
the highest score possible, but rather the highest score that
can be displayed on the screen.

In a one-player game the score is displayed at the top, left
side of the screen. In a two-player game the left player's
score is on the left; the right player's score is on the
right. The score or scores disappear when the COMMAND ALIEN
SHIP flies across the screen, then reappear when the ship
leaves the screen or is hit.

                                        Points
                                      per target

                               INSTRUCTIONS

Now, you'll never have to wait for a court again. With Tennis by
ACTIVISION (TM), you can enjoy the challenge and excitement of tennis
right on your home TV. But before you start, take a minute and read these
important instructions. They'll help you to really  enjoy all the special
features of the game. In no time you'll be playing like a pro!

                             ACTIVISION (TM)

                              TENNIS BASICS

1.      Hook up your video game system. Follow manufacturer's instructions.

2.      With power OFF, plug in game cartridge.

3.  Turn power ON. If no picture appears, check connection of your game
    system to TV, then repeat steps 1-3.

4.  Plug in Joystick Controllers.

5.  Select run with game select switch:

         Game 1: You against the Activision computer pro (full speed).
         Game 2: You against a friend (full speed).
         Game 3: You against the Activision computer pro (slow motion).
         Game 4: You against a friend (slow motion).

         NOTE: In games 1 and 3, you are the orange player; the
         computer pro is the blue player. On black and with TVs, the
         orange player is white and the blue player black.

6.  Use of Joystick Controllers. The left joystick controls the orange
    player in all games. The right joystick controls the blue player in
    games 2 and 4. Moving the joystick left moves your player left, and
    moving it right moves him right. Push forward or pull back to move to
    and from the net. Before each serve, you can only move to the right
    or left. During game action, you can move in all directions.

7.  To begin play or start a new set. Press game reset. The orange player
    begins serving each set. Players will change sides following each odd
    game. Server is shown with bouncing ball.

8.  To serve. Use the Joystick to position your player, then push the red
    button to serve. The red button is used for serving only. After serving,
    players will swing automatically if they are in position to return a shot.

9.  Difficulty Switches. With difficulty switches in the b (down) position,
    players can hit shots at a wide variety of angles -- some of them very
    sharp. With switches in the a (up) position, the widest-angle shots are
    eliminated. Left difficulty affects orange player; right difficulty
    affects blue player. Set difficulty switches at b (down) to start.

        Note to owners of Sears Tele-Games Video Arcade system:

        Difficulty switches are called skill left (or right) player and
        a (up) is expert and b (down) is novice.

10. Scoring is the same as in real tennis: 15-30-40, ""deuce"" at 40-all,
    and ""ad in"" or ""ad out"" following ""deuce"". The first player to win at
    least 6 games and be ahead by two games wins the set. If players tie
    in games at 6-6, the score returns to 0-0, and the first player to go
    two games ahead wins the set. One bell sounds after each point, three
    after each game, and six at the end of each set. Each player has his
    own bell tone.

                        SPECIAL FEATURES OF TENNIS
                            BY ACTIVISION (TM)

                          SERVING AND VOLLEYING

You can serve to any part of the court and your first serve is always
""in"". Also, you can never hit the ball to long (beyond your opponent's
baseline or sidelines) or too short (into the net). Just like in real
tennis, when you're volleying at the net, you'll notice that your shots
don't travel as far as they do when you hit them from the baseline. Also,
you'll be able to hit your most sharply-angled shots while playing at
the net.

{screen shot, pointing out ""Orange Player (Left Joystick)"", ""Blue Player
(Right Joystick or Computer)"", ""Point Score (during game), Game Score
(between games)""}

                            PLACING YOUR SHOTS

Just as in real tennis, in Tennis by ACTIVISION you can aim and ""place""
the ball depending on how you hit it. The angle of your shot is controlled
by where you hit the ball on your racket. If you hit the ball in the
center of the racket, your shot will go straight forward. The closer you
hit the ball to the edge of the racket, the sharper the angle will be in
the direction your racket is facing. But you'll need to be careful. It's
easy to attempt a sharply-angled shot and miss the ball entirely. There
are a wide variety of angles to hit the ball. Experiment with them and
you'll soon be able to precisely aim your shots and hit them out of reach
of your opponent.

                        GETTING THE FEEL OF TENNIS
                            BY ACTIVISION (TM)

Once you understand the game's basics, we suggest you start off with
game 3 or 4 and play in slow motion for a while. Put the difficulty
switches in the b (down) position. You'll soon get the feeling of the
court, when to rush the net, when to lay back and play the baseline, and
how the ball reacts when it's hit from various positions on your racket.
If the wide-angle shots are too much at first, move either or both
difficulty switches to the a (up) position while you practice. After
you've gotten a little confidence, take on the Activision computer pro
or a friend at full speed (Game 1 or 2) with full wide-angle shot
capability (difficulty switches down at b). You'll find it quite a
challenge.

Alan Miller is a Senior Designer at Activision. A fierce video game
competitor, he's the designer and undisputed champion of Checkers and
Tennis by ACTIVISION.

""My Activision Tennis, like real tennis, puts a premium on anticipation,
 reflexes, and conditioning. You really have to stay on your toes, try
 and anticipate where your opponent's shot will land, and get in position
 to return.

""Practice moving quickly to the area where you think your opponent's shot
 will go. If you can do that, then you'll get a jump on placing your shot
 out of your opponent's reach.

""For an extra tough challenge, try to serve and volley against the computer
 with the difficulty switches set on b. Hit a sharply-angled serve off the
 edge of your racket to either the right or left side, then move quickly
 about two-thirds of the way to the net.

""If you've anticipated properly, you can nail his return with a cross-court
 volley for a winner. But, guess wrong and he's passed you. This strategy
 demands a high level of concentration, razor-sharp reflexes, and lots of
 practice.

""But you know the old saying, practice makes perfect. So, keep at it, good
 luck and have a great game. Drop me a line and let me know how you do.
 I'd love to hear from you.""

                Mysterious Dissappearances!

                Authorities Baffled

_HAUNTED DUNGEONS, U.S.A._

Over the past few weeks, several professional treasure hunters have
dissappeared while exploring a dungeon reputed to house the most priceless
treasures in the world. The only known survivor has returned with stories
of monsters who eliminate anyone who dares enter the dungeon's halls and
complex labyrinth of chambers. But authorities are not taking such reports
seriously.

""We have no rational explanation for these dissappearances,"" one
investigator reported. ""All we know is that the brave soul who wants to
claim those treasures had better be sharp. At this point, the only one I
know who's clever enough for the job is Winky(TM),"" he told a crowd of
would-be hunters. ""Our hero should be ready with bow and arrows. Whoever
or whatever is guarding those treasures is determined that no one come[s]
out of there alive.""


                Getting Started

1. With your TV turned on, insert the Venture cartridge into your
   Atari 2600 (or 7800TM) as explained in your Owner's Manual, and
   turn on your console. A dungeon made up of hallways and four
   chambers appears on the screen, guarded by roaming Hallmonsters(TM).
   Winky is a small dot at the bottom of the screen.

2. Plug a joystick into the left joystick port.

3. If your are using an Atari 2600, select either color or black and
   white with the TV switch.

4. Set the Left and Right Difficulty switches to select a skill level
   from 1 to 4. (Level 1 is the easiest and 4 the most difficult.)

   Skill          Switch
   Level          Setting
     1         left B/right B
     2         left B/right A
     3         left A/right B
     4         left A/right A

5. Press _[Reset]_ to start the game or to begin a new game.


                Playing the Game

Hold the joystick so that the fire button is on the top-left corner

Move the joystick handle left, right, up, or down to make Winky run.

Position the joystick handle in the direction you want Winky to
shoot an arrow. Then press the fire button.

You'll begin your venture in the first hall of chambers. Each chamber
houses one treasure, guarded by herd of horrible and dangerous monsters.
Your goal is to capture the treasure in every chamber. To do so, you
must get past the Hallmonsters, enter each chamber, and capture the
treasure. The order for entering the chambers is up to you. But once
you grab a treasure from a chamber, you're locked out of that chamber
for good.

Capturing the treasure is no easy task. Once you enter a chamber, you
must be alert. While you're running for the treasure, the monsters
inside the chamber are running after you. You can stop them by
killing them with your arrows. But grab the treasure first, then shoot
them, to win points. If you run into a chamber monster, dead or alive,
you'll lose a Winky.

As if this weren't enough to worry about, those pesky Hallmonsters are
gettinng impatient. If you stay inside a chamber too long, they'll come
in to get you. You cannot shoot Hallmonsters, however. The only way to
protect yourself is to run from them. If they get you, you'll lose a
Winky.

The trickiest chamber of all is the Wall Room. Here you can reach the
treasure only by careful timing. Unfortunately for you, you can't shoot
the moving, electrified walls.

If you capture the treasure in every chamber, you'll descend to a new
hall of chambers, even more horrible and dangerous than the previous
one.

Remember that Winky has three backups to help out in case he runs into
trouble. The game is over if you use up all four of the Winkies.

1. INTRODUCTION

How many of you out there have always longed to be a pinball
wizard? It's a good bet that some of the places you had to go
to play a game of pinball weren't the most comfortable for
you. Well, relax. Since you were wise enough to invest in this
ATARI (r) VIDEO PINBALL TM Game Program TM, you'll never have
to worry about being at places with that kind of unsavoury
atmosphere again.

VIDEO PINBALL has the challenge and the excitement of standard
pinball games, and it doesn't have any idea what a quarter is.
So not only are you spared the unpleasant task of stuffing
quarters into hungry machines, you have the comfort and the
well-being of your home. What more could a pinball enthusiast
ask for? And as for you pinball wizards, don't think you can
master this one lickety-split. It'll be a while before your
wiz rating is restored and in full swing.

Just in case you're a pinball rookie, there's only one thing
you need to know. You're going to love it. You may have stayed
away from the more traditional places of pinball habitation in
the past, but now you're going to see why so many other people
have gone goofy with ""pinball madness"". As a matter of fact,
you'll probably catch the fever yourself within about 20
minutes.

So take a deep breath, turn up the stereo, and jump right into
VIDEO PINBALL. One more thing. Better get yourself a piggy
bank for all those quarters you're going to save.

2. OBJECT OF THE GAME

The object of the game is to keep the ball in play as long as
possible and to score as many points as possible.

Pinball is one of the fastest growing indoor sports. It
provides many forms of amusement, including competition,
challenge, excitement, and stimulation. ATARI'S VIDEO PINBALL
provides you with the challenge of pinball wizardry in your
own home.

VIDEO PINBALL TM is a game of skill and chance. It is like the
large arcade pinball games, complete with sounds and bright
colors that set the mood for the ultimate VIDEO PINBALL
challenge.

Each player starts with three balls. Every time you hit the
ATARI rollover four times, you get an extra ball. The extra
ball is indicated by a large X at the bottom of the scree.
Playing VIDEO PINBALL requires skilful control of the flippers
which are located at the bottom, center of the screen. When
the ball drops to the bottom of the screen, you send it back
into the playfield by using the flippers. The flippers are
controlled with your Joystick Controller. It's your job to
guide the ball within the playfield hitting bumpers, spinners,
targets, and rollovers to score points.

Use your Joystick Controllers to ""nudge"" the ball, but don't
""nudge"" too much, or you'll cause a ""tilt"". If you ""tilt"" the
game, your ball scores no more points and any extra balls are
lost. (See HELPFUL HINTS to learn more about nudge and tilt.)

3. USING THE CONTROLLERS

Use your Joystick Controllers with this ATARI (r) Game Program
TM. 

Be sure to plug the controller cables firmly into the jacks at
the back of your Video Computer System TM.

Hold the controller with the red button to your upper left
toward the television screen. Use the LEFT CONTROLLER jack for
one-player games. See Section 3 of your owners manual for
further details.

Use the Joystick Controller to move your flippers. Move the
Joystick to the right to move the right flipper up, and to the
left to move the left flipper up. Move the Joystick up to move
both flippers at the same time.



          Both Flippers
                ^
              \ | /
Left Flipper <-----> Right Flipper
              / | \
                v
  

Use you Joystick Controller to start the game. Pull the
Joystick down (towards you) to bring the plunger back. 

Press the red controller button to release the spring and
shoot the ball into the playfield.

You can also use your Joystick Controller to ""nudge"" or apply
""body English"" on the ball. ""Nudge"" or ""body English"" means
forcing the ball to go in a particular direction. To do this,
hold the red button down while you push the Joystick in the
direction you want the ball to go. All games allow you to
""nudge "" the ball. (See GAME VARIATION for further
explanation.)

4. CONSOLE CONTROLS

To select a VIDEO PINBALL game, press down the game select
switch.

The number of players for each game appears at the upper left
corner of the television screen. The game number appears to
the right of the player number. 

When you have selected the game you want to play, press down
the game reset switch to start the action.

Each time game rest is pressed down the game starts over. When
game play starts, the player number and the ball number appear
at the top of the screen to the left of the score.

Difficulty Switches

VIDEO PINBALL offers two difficulty levels - a and b. The a
level is for expert pinball players, also known as pinball
wizards. The b level game is for the beginning or novice
pinball player. The a level game has two extra drain holes at
the bottom of the playfield. Each VIDEO PINBALL player may
choose his or her own difficulty level. In a one-player game,
use the left difficulty switch. For two-player games, the left
player uses the left difficulty switch; the right player uses
the right difficulty switch. Difficulty levels may be changed
at any time during game play.

5. SCORING

You score points each time your ball hits targets, bumpers,
rollovers, or spinners. The scoring is fast, and you'll hear
special electronic sounds as points are scored. When bonus
points are scored the screen flashes. Scores are posted at the
top right of the screen. In two-player games, each player's
score appears with each turn. At the end of a two-player game
both player's scores alternate at the top of the screen.

Points are scored as follows:

SPINNERS
1 point each time the ball hits the spinner.

BUMPERS
100 times their current value. The value inside the bumper
increases time all of the diamond shaped drop targets are
knocked down.

DROP TARGETS
100 points each time a drop target is hit.

ATARI ROLLOVER

100 points; after hitting the ATARI rollover four times, you
receive an extra ball. Each time it rolls over, the bonus
multiplier increases by one. Only one extra ball can be
awarded with each turn. The number of ATARI rollovers hit is
indicated at the bottom of the screen by one [atari symbol]
for each hit.

LEFT ROLLOVER
100 points each time it rolls over. Its value increases by one
with each hit. When the ball drains, you receive 1000 points
for each time it has rolled over, (up to 4000 points).

SPECIAL LIT TARGET
This target lights up for only four seconds. It is located
between the two lower bumpers. Each time it is hit, the screen
flashes and you score 1000 points.

The bonus multiplier is tallied at the end of a turn.

This rapid scoring is accompanied with a ""whirring"" sound.
When you have scored one million points the score rolls over
and starts again. When this happens you do not lose the
additional 999999 points, they remain part of your score.

6. GAME VARIATIONS

VIDEO PINBALL has four exciting game variations. There are two
games for one player and two games for two players. The
variations are:

GAME 1 is a one-player game. GAME 1 allows you to nudge the
ball. Too much nudge will cause you to lose the ball (TILT)
and any extra ball is lost. During GAME 1 the bumper values
are accumulated for an entire game.

GAME 2 is a two-player version of GAME 1. Each player takes at
turn with one ball at a time. The turn lasts until the ball
drains. Each player's score appears at the top of the screen
with each turn. The left player is always number one.

GAME 3 is a one-player game similar to GAME 1 except that the
bumper values are not accumulated. The bumper values are reset
with each new ball. GAME 3 is just a bit tougher than GAME 1.
For a real challenge, try GAME 3 with difficulty level a.

GAME 4 is a two-player version of GAME 3. Each player takes a
turn with one ball at a time. The turn lasts until the ball
drains. Each player's score appears at the top of the screen
with each turn. As in GAME 2, the left player starts the game.

7. HELPFUL HINTS

TILT
Tilt is caused by nudging the ball too much. When a tilt
occurs, the top portion of the television screen turns red,
your flippers are frozen, you cannot score points, and
eventually the ball is lost through a drain. If an extra ball
was earned before a tilt, you lose it. You still retain the
bonus earned from the left rollover.

NUDGE
Nudging can be very helpful in preventing a lost ball. If the
ball gets too close to a drain, you can use a nudge to move
the ball and prevent it from dropping down the drain. Nudge
the ball by holding the red controller button down whilst
pushing the Joystick in the direction you want the ball to go.
You can also use a nudge to help score points by nudging the
ball towards a rollover or target.

BANK SHOT
Use the flippers to maneuver the ball so that it rebounds off
a playfield device (bumper, rollover etc.), and then moves
toward a specific target.

PLUNGER
Experiment with the plunger. Try pulling it halfway back, or
all the way back, or anywhere in between. You might find you
have better control over the ball with a particular plunger
setting. Sometimes, a combination of plunger setting and
nudging will help send the ball in the direction of the ATARI
rollover."
